            "hear me out This is something that I wanted to do for ages A game that I paid €200 for I know it sounds ridiculous but it is true You think I'm trolling i'm not trolling I can show you the receipt where I literally paid €200 minus €173 on King for one of the last copies of Minecraft Story Mode The servers are already down but you can still play it Hey one of the few people who have it on Steam W game Collectors and Shambles All right boys Did we get scammed or not i think we go in and we have a look for ourselves Minecraft story mode We go in No clue what to expect This is basically the Minecraft movie but as a game Telltale games X Mojang guys I get really easily emotional And if we have like a dog pet or something in the story mode then I am going to cry Minecraft story mode Choose your appearance So we have three female characters I think Ooh that looks nice Green buckle black shirt with some gray elements And he also looks a little bit angry I like that Look at his eyebrows here I identify with this guy The Order of Stone episode one Alter This looks kind of cool There is a command block on the floor 3 2 1 This game series adapts to the choices you make The story is tailored by how you play Nothing built can last forever And every legend no matter how great fades with time With each passing year more and more details are lost until all that remains are myths half-truths to put it simply lies And yet in all the known universe between here and the Farlands the legend of the Order of the Stone endures unabbridged as self-evident fact Indeed it is only a troubled land that has need for heroes and ours was fortunate to have so long ago four heroes such as these Gabriel the warrior before whose sword all combatants would tremble This looks Eligard the redstone engineer whose machines would spark an era of invention Magnus the rogue who would channel his destructive creativity for the benefit of all and Saurin the architect builder of worlds and leader of the order of the stone Damn these four friends together so much to gain their rightful place as four heroes Their greatest quest would take them on a dangerous journey to fight a mysterious creature known as the Ender Dragon In the end the Order of the Stone emerged victorious and the dragon was defeated Their story complete they slipped away into the pages of legend Am I crazy i I'm invested already This is clean But when one story ends another one begins Would you rather fight a 100 chickensized zombies wooden sword Or 10 zombiesized chickens no Not that [ __ ] again Not that [ __ ] again Do you remember the one guy who asked [ __ ] size chicken chicken size zombies Or zombie size chickens Uh zombie zombiesized chickens It's just a hypothetical question Jesse So I've got a daylight sensor on the roof Mhm And if I did this right these lamps should turn on once it gets dark Mhm I didn't want to just leave Reuben here with nothing while we're at the building competition He's coming with us Really what chicken is that of course he is Okay I'm not saying he shouldn't come I'm not But don't you think it's a little weird that you take him with you everywhere you go he kind of makes us look like I don't know Reuben is my best friend Reuben is my best friend Reuben's my best friend I thought I was your best friend Both of you are I didn't mean anything by it I'm glad you animals always first I just don't want to give people one more reason to call us losers I'm getting tired of it Who [ __ ] cares what they think laughing stock This is my iron opinion too Who cares what other people think i know I'm just It wears you down You say you're not a loser Olivia So win Okay Reuben Fine You hear that someone snorting coke Oh no Move Reuben Ow man You guys totally freaked out Now move on You piece of [ __ ] What's the matter with you great Now I'm going to smell like a pig in Endercon Not funny Axel Thought we were buddies That wasn't funny Axel I brought you good times and now I'm being punished for it You scared us half to death Did you bring the fireworks chad you don't even see it There's a Telly tale classic that you haven't seen so far Every time I make a choice you will see in a second Chad am I the only one that loves this i love this chat Subtitles I'll turn subtitles on Okay Uh do we have some people who who are blind dude I'm invested This looks so good Now look top left Every time you make a choice it says he will remember that Not every time but Of course I did I even brought something for the little guy Nice You brought Reuben a disguise Um we're going to a convention Somebody's got to wear a costume I'm in If he's happy I'm happy As long as Reuben is happy I'm happy Happy well zippity doodah Okay relax It's fine You definitely brought the fireworks right yes I'm ready Waiting on you guys If he was really your best friend you wouldn't let him go outside dressed like that The only thing more dangerous than putting a costume on a pig is trying to take it off Hurry up and grab your stuff We'll meet you downstairs Okay Okay Dude no shot This is peak gaming Call me crazy Holy [ __ ] Let's check the chest Come on Netherite Definitely knees Netherite Never know when I might need to shear some sheep Not bad That's two iron Not bad What is this gabriel the warrior You think we'll ever get that famous it's not impossible Maybe I'll get famous for my sweet poster collection We will brother We will Trust me Another chest Netherite H Steel Flint and steel Flint and steel Chicken jockey Oh man How do I Ooh I can WD Reuben give me a dragon roar Reuben that'll do Reuben That'll do Uh dude if if Reuben dies throughout the story I may cry I'm not going to lie I I'm not even going to look at chat now but that would break my heart I swear on God Okay another banner One of these days we're going to win the Endercon building competition And when we do look at us and say \"Hey there goes Jesse and Reuben winners of the Endercon building competition.\" A really should change the name Endercon is crazy Okay Armor stand I got this stand as a gift but don't have any armor to put on it Maybe someday Wait can you see all the subtitles with my cam in this position trapoor Let's go down A Reuben that's everything Let's roll Yeah dude Roll Let's go I heard a pretty juicy rumor about the building competition but you guys have to promise not to say anything Okay Also it's in two parts Each part more exciting than the last Spit it out Axel Part one the special guest at this year's Anacon is none other than Gabriel the Warrior him freaking self Whoa What's part two part two according to my sources the winner of the building competition is going to get to meet him It doesn't mean anything if we lose but if we win oh man I'd love to meet Gabriel for all the losing Meeting Gabriel would be a dream and an honor He's awesome It would be amazing to meet him Reuben better be careful in that costume The last time Gabriel saw a dragon it didn't end well So does this source of yours make posters for a living huh what yeah my uh source uh doesn't exist You guys are my only friends Guys let's stay focused We have a competition to win It's okay Axel I'll never win And this year we've got Reuben with us We basically have no chance We'll win this time We're going to win because What are you talking about because up to now we've hated losing But today today my friends we're going to start learning how to love winning Yes That didn't sound as good as it did in my head No no I'm with that All right Wait a minute Wait a minute We're thinking about this all wrong The point of the building competition isn't just to build something We have to do something to get noticed by the judges I'll be I'll build a penis So how do we do this we don't just build something functional We build something fun Bye guys After we finish the fireworks machine like we planned then we build something cool on top of it We might be on to something If we want to get a reaction out of the judges you build something scary So I say we build a creeper Wouldn't an enderman be better i'm more scared of Enderman than creepers They both have their moments Both pretty scary Then again you scared the crap out of us with a creeper today I feel like Enderman is cooler Let's build an Enderman Uh Olivia's thing Are you whining no I was saying awome Yeah I think this is the first time we've decided on something before getting to the competition Think we've got everything we need it wouldn't hurt to grab a little more Let's get to grabbing then We're so prepared We can't lose Cannot bring it in To prepare on three No no no no Preparing is Derek No that's that's the same thing Forget it Uh team on three One two three Team prepare We got this boys Let's get ready Let's get some more loot and then we will build the enderman and win that competition Let's mine That first we mine and then we craft Reuben mind

diamond for it Being a resident go-getter pays off every once in a while Literally Also a thunder skull worth that much what that's not what I meant Are you kidding for all the trouble I had to go to

up Man looks like Lucas and his ocelots won again Sorry Jesse But you've got to admit that beacon does look pretty sweet Yeah Yeah I just wanted this to be the year we finally beat that jerk You know Lucas may be kind of arrogant but he has come through for me in tricky situations You might want to get to know him just in case [ __ ] He's good at building that's for sure It's always useful to have a guy like that around No matter what you might think of him personally None Just think about it Okay come on Let's hurry I couldn't decide Remember what Endercon was like before it was cool remember what we were like before we were cool some of us will never be cool Haha They were creepers Well time to use that new sword Oh [ __ ] If this Wait if this bridge breaks through the creeper from behind

need you to let me do the talking Okay I just don't want anything to screw this up I'll keep quiet or anyone Sure I'll let you handle it And if you want to be really useful try to look intimidating Oh I'm good at that Like this I'm less scared of you than scared for you Jesse and Petra Hey you all know Petra my new super close friend We're super close now Yep We ran into each other while I was looking for Reuben For Reuben what happened to his eye we had a little runin with some zombies They whacked him good but Reuben held his own What were you doing in the woods Petra nothing just drawn by the sound of Jesse's high-pitched screams I would have been spider baited if she hadn't found me I got to admit I'm pretty bummed they won again I mean there's no way we were going to let you go after Reuben by yourself but it's okay to be a little disappointed right or like a lot disappointed The saddest of the sad sacks I mean they did deserve it They deserve this Olivia Even you've got to admit that Yeah Yeah And I agree but then also still hate them and everything they stand for Yeah Hey Jesse it's time to go see about that thing Oh right The thing Subtle Yeah As a punch to the face Axel and I were going to head into Endercon anyway See you in there I heard somebody saying there's free cake by the map booth Ooh Hurry We're supposed to meet in the hour behind Minecraft Dark dark and ox would hit That's weird He said the dark creepy alley close to the gates but he's not here Maybe he's late Are you sure this is the dark creepy alley he meant h I was Okay new plan You stay here

already Do you have the skull uh well is he a griefer you do or you don't You'd better not be toying with it Petra has it She'll be back any minute now Well as long as she's bringing it I suppose it wouldn't kill me to wait a minute longer Chad you can use wither schools to create a wither in the overworld He may be a griefer This is awkward Ivore Oh thank God Here she is Sorry I'm late but good things are worth waiting for I've got what you asked for If you have what you promised us You didn't say anything about an us when we first met And I don't like surprises Shut up If these are the sorts of people you associate with perhaps we should call the whole thing off My friend is fine right Jesse there's no problem here Let's not be too hasty okay this is just a little misunderstanding Ah I find Aman Looks like we're good to go Give me one more second Then bro I was thinking I'll take that diamond now Just take it You've earned it Wait he may be a scammer What if he runs what if

I'm not leaving without you The gang needs you Jesse Go through the portal If anything happens I'll meet you guys at the temple Stay safe No No Lock in Yes Oh no Thanks Jesse Gabriel's still up there Get him Get him Jesse go No No Oh my god That's impossible What oh no Oh no The Nether Where's Petra but what about Gabriel we did everything we could What are you saying Jesse what is he talking about because it doesn't sound It doesn't sound good I know I I know Petra's still up there I got scared just for a second You got scared it wasn't my fault You got scared and it's not your fault Calm down Back off Axel We got to go back No we just have to wait Think about what you're walking into We have to go back We should go back She just needs more time Petra needs our help We're going Hey there she is Come on Come on Petra [ __ ] All right it's time You again It's time Oh my god No no no no no Go go go That's really really bad Ivore you ruined everything Chad does he have any chance to redeem thief to us you took my most valuable potion In what should have been my moment of triumph she is a completely disgusting probably a single child who's trying to impress people It solves nothing Never such a lesson now or you'll share Gabriel's fate This is not the way There's nothing left up there Nothing but that wither storm Why are we threatening so many lives today jerk We have to go and get Petra The girl I saw her What while I was running toward the portal I passed her She was running in the opposite direction What such bravery Of course there's a fine line between bravery and stupidity What and your friend has crossed it I'm saying she's stupid Our friend Our friend is in trouble because of you We're trapped in the Nether because of you You have much bigger problems to contend with Dude I want to kill him That tunnel is a network of minecarts built by the Order of the Stone It's your only way out We should go that way Took me to T- vibes Nether highway Wasting Let's go Much as I hate to admit it he might be right He might be Bravo for embracing the truth Chad I don't know Am I delusion now what was that i would wish you good luck but luck won't carry you through the Nether You have my sympathies No Invisibility This scumbag All right Next time he dies on site mark my words Next time he dies on site mark my words Let's get out of here Run Chad This is before the friendly gas update All the guests are not nice You cannot write them This must be what Ivore was talking about Come on Got it Oh no [Music] Everybody hold on Holy [ __ ] Wow The Nether Yeah that is a lot of lava and fire and other things that could burn you to death This is sick Oh no Oh that's a drop That is very very much a drop You guys what drop you weren't kidding Here we go I know Minecraft I've played the game before Axel being a hole in the ground Got it Watch it Got it Okay So I'm not the only one seeing that we're running out of track right i know Good Never Never Jesse that switch now Do it Oh arms Don't fail me now No Got it Wow I thought something bad was going to happen there but I guess everything's going to be Whoa Get Oh man Whoa whoa whoa Uh Axel Oh Olivia Reuben who built this whoa no no no no Hang on Reuben Giant Reuben Okay Reuben remember how I said everything was going to be just fine before i know I was wrong then but I have a very good feeling about Whoa Duck Got it What how does that make any sense oh no Now now Oh my god I'm him Holy smokes Return to the gas Officially crossed off my deceas Done with the gas Never need to see them Oh crap How many can we take he needs to go to the vet now [Music] Guys how cinema is this game am I crazy your throat's going to be sore later Axel Why i'm just saying Wasn't that you doing all that screaming before sounded like you were really shredding your larynx Oh yeah I don't know I heard that too Really high-pitched Kind of like a squeaky piston What no Shut up Never mind Must have We were last We were just lucky to make it out alive That's more than most people can say Their bones are probably still sizzling away in that lava down there Wow I'm morbid Sorry Jesus Jesus Whoa What the hell is that can you throw up like inside your body this ain't a bash I know because I just did about five times Wow look at this place All these tracks converge at this point You could probably get anywhere in the world from here There's the portal This is what Gabriel was talking about That's our way out Careful It must lead back to the surface The surface is also where that creature is He's right We have no idea what we're walking into It could be dangerous One block in the Nether is eight blocks in the overworld We did travel a far not going to lie I feel like this should be saved Thanks for being so brave Axel All right I'm going to go I'm going I'm going right now Like right right now Uh I just need to make sure I have everything I'll need Loki I want to go first I think I put the uh thing over in the He seems he he wants to go first It's fine I'll do it That's not what I was saying I'm going Well if you absolutely insist This guy Well see you guys on the other side Yes Be careful Thanks Jesse Here we go Okay Here we go boys I'm going to do it I'm I'm going to go through this portal first Here we go Wish me luck guys Any moment I'm going to go in now [ __ ] [Music] Oh brother Okay Not what I was expecting I mean careful It's fine We have a spot in There it is There it is Wow There's lotion That was close Axel there was a zombie Oh is it dead i mean you know dead dead Brother is a softy Where are we in the dark in the middle of nowhere Maybe we should bed down for the night Yeah it's dangerous to be out when it's this dark I thought we were headed toward a temple We're looking for a giant building It should be pretty obvious Ivor said Oh I've already said \"Well then maybe this is the temp.\" I'm being sarcastic Axel Come on We're vulnerab We have to build a shelter I thought that was what I said but uh you're right We should hurry I say we build a treehouse That'll take forever and we'll be exposed while we do it We just need a quick and dirty hut Look whatever it is we got to do it fast I'm scared of a baby zombie What in a hut we won't know what's coming until it's knocking on our door A treehouse is going to be spider town I hate spiders Let's go with a treehouse Sounds cool It's functional It'll keep us out of danger It's not a bad idea All right fine Let's get started then Here we go First we mine and then we crack dirt Good job Lucas Ya There we go There we go There we go There we go Put the ladder down Treehouse already looking decent Bang Bang Bang If I wake up with a spider on my face I'm going to expect you to deal with it Lower your expectations Axel Well maybe if we'd built into the tree a little bit more it could have Never mind It's This is fine It's good Looks good guys W laga for you Lucas Oh man What i'm going to tell you something You have to promise not to freak out What is it chicken jockey I have cookies Yo never mind One for me one for Olivia one for Jesse Oh thanks Axel Chad I'll split it I'll give Luca some and one for Reuben No no it's fine But I do want the full one No it's I don't know what I would do I'm not that hungry anyway In game I'll give him but low key I would eat it in the morning or something Dude those cookies look busting Wait I said key I said give No Oh no My mistake Wait I misclicked I went with RL option Whoops Hey it's just a cookie Just comes with us Which would you rather fight 100 chicken-sized zombies or 10 zombiesized chickens choose wisely Yep Uh that's a good one Let me think How can you guys joke at a time like this petra is still out there She's all by herself There's nothing funny about that Can't just mope Got to keep our spirits high No we should be moping That's exactly what we should be doing Axel I'm right Right Maybe but she's going to be fine What makes you think that she has to be [ __ ] fine then Uh we should get some rest I should battle about the cookie Got to start looking for this temple as early as we can Now my guess is if we start at the portal and kind of split up Oh what are you doing did I do something to you i'd really like to know because you keep getting on my case for what seems like no reason Trying to help He's just trying to help See I'm sorry Jesse I'm not going to sit here and listen to this guy telling us what's what I'm just trying to get ready for tomorrow You're the only one wearing that stupid jacket Don't tell us what to do Take that back I can't It's just a jacket You know what i get to wear this jacket because I know how to build But that doesn't mean I don't know how to break things Your threats don't scare me now that we know how you really are Jesse your friend is way out of line Oh I wasn't going to bring it up but I can only take so much Axel was being a dick [ __ ] Easy Not going to lie Threatened me He's not going to do anything Haven't you done enough damage for one day petra might be dead because of you You're taking this too far Axel I don't have to take this Listen why don't I just leave and let you guys hash this out oh no You can't leave It's dangerous out there I can take care of myself It's what Axel wants right you're staying with us Let him leave if he wants to leave You're not going anywhere But Jesse that's enough We're all on the same team now He's staying Trust Trust We're in this together But you two have to be sized chickens That's what I would fight Why is that because I'm starving Of course That's the same answer Rain is better than monsters Thanks for keeping me around Jesse Of course Yeah Of course Chief We got this together [Music] Wait Okay Sunny day The mobs are gone The sun is shining These two are still not nice to each other It's fine We're going to We're going to fix that chat We're going to fix that today First we check He's going to lie to us It's okay Sorry about all that business last night Honestly I'm just I'm more embarrassed than anything else Hey there's something over that way What is it what is it some kind of building I think Village Let's get a closer look Ruin portal Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa What the hell is that that's That's That's the amulet [Music] That has to be it This has to be the place What is this place that's what we're trying to figure out It's the Temple of the Order of the Stone Yeah Lucas are you sure he's right Look Holy crap Do you think they're in there let's go in and find out Let's just all be careful bro This chat Y'all are taking this way too serious bro Lucas says he cannot shake it because he's a [ __ ] First time chatter Chill G Brother is invested Loki's got a point Okay here we go Okay if you spot anything call it out We don't have a lot of time Isn't it weird how dispensers are carved to look like spooky little faces wait Traps Traps What do you dispense little guy oh no No No Arrows I get the feeling that we don't really want to find out Pressure behind me Are those pressure [Music] plates right there right there I see it Got to go around that Careful guys Reuben Whoa What was that that's probably not a good thing Oh come on Dispenser bases I thought we were friends Run Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Lock in Lock in I don't know how much health we have I didn't die once I want to do a flawless run We're trapped Just wait It's not infinite arrows Dispensers with that pressure plate If we can figure out a way to trigger it again I bet that'll shut him off There's a crafting table Maybe we can make something useful Out of what we don't have anything All of our tools and materials are back home All right everyone Your pockets Let's see what we've got to work with I have a few sticks left over from building the shelter last night I've got some flint and a piece of string All I have are some chicken feathers I picked up after that chicken machine exploded Let's see I've got some flint and steel bow A sword Oh and some string from a spider that I fought String sticks flint and feathers A bow Oh no Oh I actually don't know how to c Oh jeep bus Um and then this Wait I actually don't know how to make a bow Is it wait No feather N the other way around Is it like this wait I know How is it on the bow do I cheat do I check recipes oh are you [ __ ] serious right now G oh my god There we go bro Okay Wait the the the the the arrows Uh feather stick flint All right guys Listen Listen There we Oh dude Without the crafting book it will be GG Not going to lie Let's do this Lock and ch We don't have many arrows though [Music] All right The order of the pig's luck is changing Dude this game is [ __ ] cinema Am I crazy i love it This must be their enchantment room This is all stuff that we know from my Doesn't this look like Ivor's creepy basement and cool characters how's this game discontinued why did they not like want to have this as their Minecraft story mode this is great Did nobody play this find anything useful not sure about useful but definitely interesting There is a lot of history in this room [Music] Ah I remember I think I watched a video on why this game failed I think it's because the problem was that YouTubers made video on it immediately and once you watch a YouTuber play it then you don't buy it I think that was the reason right like you're not going to replay this after watching a [ __ ] video on it It's a story mode I think that was the issue [Music] The battle was fierce but the order of the stone emerged triumphant saving the land and ensuring that peace and prosperity would reign forever Well not exactly forever These five members five friends together would give so much to gain their rightful place As five heroes they would author their own end They would slay a dragon Ivore was a member of the Order of the Stone The stories never mentioned him This is so crazy This might explain why Ivor had such a grudge against Gabriel They lied to us They lied to the whole world Why would they do this man I can't believe you punched a member of the Order of the Stone This is so crazy The Order might not be what we thought they were but Petra is still out there That monster is still out there Jesse's right We need to focus on what we came here to do Where do these stairs go so is he mad because he got like pushed out of the group they didn't give him no props no nothing even though he was part of Out of the Stone Did I get that right only one way to find out Only one way to find out bro That's toxic low key And then he turned insane huh gabriel all the flashing lights He's mad This is cool Wow What happened to the walls more like what happened to this whole place This must have been where they met So where are they then gabriel said that once we find the temple the amulet would lead us to the Order of the Stone Well what are you waiting for pull it out then Oh god Is something supposed to happen well that was a let down There's got to be something we're missing Look around and see if you can find anything What are you doing Axel what you looking at nothing Whatever Axel I was just trying to figure out where Petra might be I mean I know she's going to be fine but I was just curious We're going to find her W Axel Low key Cheddy is a softy deep inside It's okay She's a little bit protective about the group you know a little bit too protective N the entire world This is way nicer than the one at Endercon Trust me he's a W Find anything interesting in that book the only thing I found so far is that the amulet was used to track the positions of the members of the order And does it mention how it's less technical and well more historical Interesting What is this it's the same as the amulet Hold up Hold the phone Let me check how Reuben is doing Hey Reuben Find any clues it's fine G We'll take care of it Classic Ruben Whoa Check with Olivia first We're in the temple of the Order of the Stone The Order's actual temple Who' have thought it huh a bunch of smalltowners like us wrapped up in an adventure like this Yeah it's pretty insane I just hope we all come out the other side in one piece Facts Facts We will We will What are these levers do blue [Music] Red blue blue cyan blue green blue cyan white green white blue blue blue cyan Man how are kids going to do this one what the hell i don't even know Wait what what if [Music] I red okay Hey Oh I didn't mean to do that Wait maybe we want the blue Okay Okay No Try again [Music] What what can't use it No We may need that though We may need that Oh [Music] Okay Where's the scan could be Could be [Music] No No What was this one again oh hell no All right This one needs to go off And now there's a double wasn't there one of these two [Music] Wow Lock in It's absolutely incredible Wa How did they build this okay now I'm impressed Must be a tracking system This looks like some sort of tracking system It's the order It's showing where they are right now Look we don't know enough about how this thing works Maybe the amulet only tracks them when they're on the surface All right stop being a Or maybe it doesn't work when they're in the Nether We have to go off what we do know I mean he is right though He is right though Chad Um we have to Oh man No That wither storm is still out there We know that Gabriel was trying to tell us something We've got to find the Order of the Stone But there are only two There are only two members of the order left He said Saurin was missing That leaves Magnus or Eligard Let's head out I'm not going with you guys I have to stay here What if I know Petra she's probably doing everything she can to find this place She's still out there She has to be We might need your help out there You should come with us No you don't need me This is where I should be If there's even a small chance she's alive I have to stay If she's If she can make it yes she's fine I'm going to focus on making this place safe before nightfall This temple is pretty big though If we're going to have a chance at fortifying it I'm going to need some help If uh hell no Maybe one of you guys can hang back with me Hell no Sounds like Olivia will have you totally covered while me and Jesse are out finding Magnus Bro wants to go with the finding Magnus You really think that's how it's going to go we need Eligard She's the world's greatest engineer She'll figure out a way to stop that thing We're trying to destroy it And when it comes to destruction Magnus is the master M you're a smart person Jesse And obviously the smart thing to do is to go get Magnus I think Axel meant Eligard there Jesse Chad Uh no Which one was who again i don't think I did Pretty sure Axel meant Magnus Jesse the point is you should Who was the clear choice to make which one what did they You're my best friend Jesse It's you and me like always Think about it Jesse Magnus is TNT more of a gun And what was we need to make sure we get this right What was redstone we're not going to get a second shot at this Whatever decision you make I'll be clear Redstone Really that sounds me Come on Jesse This is an easy call And fighting a wither with TNT doesn't sound really smart I feel like a smart redstone engineer can make anything possible in Minecraft Goggles What i'm going to keep it real to say if this was a real life decision I had to choose between a red stoner or a TNT No brain just crafting TNT and [ __ ] maybe have some tactics with like I don't know with like uh how do you say with the pushers he can like make a TNT cannon but that's maximum The TNT cannon he can't even build without a red stoner The red stoner is the fundament of Minecraft It's the only way you can like be creative in Minecraft People build Minecraft in Minecraft using Redstone And if she can do that she can kill that [ __ ] wither I'm going red I don't care what anyone says We're going with Elegard Olivia you and I are going to Elegard Awesome Axel you stay here with Lucas and get the place ready for when Petra shows up What with that guy does feel bad though leaving Axel i'm right here Come on Axel For Petra's sake Fine I'll do it for Petra No I want him with us Take it Oh no Oh wait Leaving these two guys behind us Oh wait Please hurry No What does that mean next time Jesse and Olivia return to the Nether intent on finding the way they want to say the next episode I said \"Please hurry.\" And as a kid you don't want to let down themselves in a place of mechanical redstone Please hurry is crazy amazing machine limited only by the imagination of their brilliant creator While the great storm grows consuming everything in its wake Time Wait Skip skip skip I skip it right because spoiler We're going back It's time This is so cool The amount of engineering it must have taken to do this Automated train tracks running all through the Nether connecting all the different order members She's right though And imagine the scaffolding you'd need to make all this Elegard was probably fighting off zombie pigmen with one hand wiring redstone with the other We're in the Nether Watch out for monsters Okay I have to If we don't get the order back together the wither storm is going to eat everything We're going to get to Eligards get her to help us and we're going to save the world I hope you're right We definitely stand a better chance with Elegard's help Uh Jesse Oh no Lucky Ow Ow Hide Great More gas Oh the minecarts Only two people can fit in a mine Do something about the gas Okay think fast Jesse What to choose roll B's right You know it So long as you really know what you're doing with it What's this now we have two skewered Ah what is seven i think I got it Okay we're all set to go again Hitting the power tracks now Time to move buddy Let's go A I never doubted you for a second but but that was incredible Maybe we have a chance of getting to Eligard after all Look there's the sign Red Stonia Red Stonia here we come Red Stonia We're about to meet the greatest redstone builders in the world Holy [ __ ] Wow Who would have thought that someday I'd really get to visit Red Stonia Eligard's capital city of engineering that's way more impressive than the TNT guy Do you think Elegard will be willing you know to help us it's like meeting the guy on top of the mountain the wisest person Like bro Redstone if you master redstone Minecraft you're the smartest guy ever He's going to have so much cool [ __ ] [Music] Whoa Red [ __ ] stonia huh mama mia God [Music] damn All right I got them pistons ready I some slime block action Lots and lots of [Music] pistons Builders of Rstonia I want you to know how much I value and adore each and every one of you Your hard work inspires me every day A goat There she is I am about to enter my dome of concentration where I will be unreachable for the foreseeable future What but I will emerge when I complete my latest and greatest creation That's me when I'm going to reach [Applause] So please continue working continue building and whichever person most impresses me they shall be my protege ready to help usher in a new era of innovation and creativity Calvin throw the switch She's so smart You can you can hear it in her verse in her in her voice She is clever She is so clever Jesse we need to get there before she totally locks herself in Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Go go go go go Whoa whoa whoa whoa [Music] What oh Oh crap Why is that TNT excuse me Mr Calvin Was it we need to speak to Eligard It's urgent Are those TNT cannons to defend i'm afraid that's quite impossible Did you hear the speech she's on lockdown until she completes her next great invention But lucky for you I'm here How can I help you uh I mean I'm no Elig but I'm still pretty cool Take us sir Well you need to take us to her It's really really important No I'm afraid not Look I can tell you're not from around here Level with me Who are you why do you need to see Eligar fair We don't do tours this time of year I must tell you I have a message from Elegard isn't one for I have a message from Gabriel Okay Eligard's old friend You must admit that this all sounds a little outlandish Jesse show him the amulet Do we have it look this is Gabriel's amulet It's how I got here It's how I found Elegard in the first place Uh-oh Oh my Well that is interesting If you'd like I could send that to Elellard Maybe that would help your mission I'm not giving that [ __ ] Be a bad idea I'm not I'm not trusting him with that Of course You might also want to hang on to We do it ourselves Help No way Gabriel gave this amulet to me No way am I parting with it Well fine then I don't have time for this I don't trust this guy I'm afraid I have many more things to attend to than answering all of your questions I must go Better just take this repeater and disable the stair controls We don't want any troublemakers disturbing Eligard All right we'll craft one dumbass What do we Guess we'll need to get another repeater Red stone right stone maybe iron I don't know dumbass But he thinks he's got the only repeat on the world Hey Reuben He's kind of scared that they're going to like I don't know put Ruben in an automated farm or something These red stoners you never know chat You never know man Let me see what we're doing over mouth don't exactly have a wide spectrum of emotions so it's hard to tell if they're happy or traumatized Reuben is just

My poor machine Ah I can't let a Garcia like this She'll never make me her protege Oh how am I ever going to fix this one repeat dumbass Bloody is clueless Okay here we go Thank god we didn't have to craft one We got free redstone and [ __ ] We don't even need to use it Where can't I go there we go Boom Okay that's a step in the right direction Uh I don't [ __ ] know Switch is on Okay good Good Switch is on That doesn't seem super useful I'm working on it Olivia These aren't exactly labeled you know Bam Door open Nice Nice Here we go Will she be mad if we just if we interrupt her during her uh during her thinking phase elegard's Redstone Laboratory Seems more like an entrance Surely not like the words Oh don't worry pal We'll find her I just hope she can actually help us She will She will All right This door is just going to open once you step on it Classic What an invention Wow That's actually crazy That's actually crazy What my gosh Glow stone dust lapis lary That might be the most redstone stuff I've ever seen in my life You can say that again Does she have an automated farm moving or is it a sorting system of some sort whoa whoa whoa What are those things even for maybe I don't know Breaking things up Keeping intruders out There are lots of possibilities Wait I don't know how red I don't know how red zone works I'm going to give it a bug I've never understood a repeater Looks like I can adjust the settings on this thing I mean let's try Okay almost Definitely a step in the right direction Slower now Holy [ __ ] Nicely done Jesse So it's just the delay of when it activates Hey what can I say me and the redstone just speak to each other How do people make like PCs in Minecraft with just redstone repeaters that's so insane man Look at all this Huh whatever she's working on if it requires all of these ingredients Any idea what all this does well it's clearly taking all of these materials and doing something with them but I'm not sure what yet But boy am I going to find out Come on let's keep moving Like chat people make like calculs and stuff in Minecraft with just redstone Like what i mean at the end of the day PCS as well it's just code like with zero and ones right it's just like yes or no I guess you can like somehow with redstone signal or no signal like make it somehow I don't know That sounds crazy though Create logic gates All right calm down Let me let me finish this game All right this is already like making my brain fume Wait should I put this yes That's awesome Zipper lever zipper Look Whoa This close to meeting Eligard Getting excited like you wouldn't believe I wonder what she'll really be like in person Dude these guys are glazers and fanboys Like the world is ending We're looking trying to save our friends H Jesus Wait do you use the button or the lever uh I'll push it Are those bats yeah I wonder why she even has that circuit Oh I didn't [ __ ] up lever Pull Is that water whoa Water and science That's smart Wow It's an elevator dude You go faster this way right then normal water There she is God damn It was a sorting system I think this is just like I dreamt it That's the entering Eligard's laboratory Seeing her right there she'll ask me to be her apprentice and the next thing you know we'll be changing the world together Let's just try to save the world first Time to pace back and forth and check the systems Inventory request operational Delivery latency speedy Talking to myself Yep Let's go in now Okay All right One more second Let's rock this block with another test Now we go Whoa Hi Hey Didn't see you sneaking up on me Guess that's the point Don't touch anything in here Okay So supremely fragile and genius Did Calvin send you are you my new assistants huh new assistance with a stupidly adorable pig That is Jesse She thinks we're her new assistants We need your help This is so exciting I'm keeping it No time for specifics I'm afraid Hey you goggle girl Switch on that T-flop circuit to activate the delivery shoots And you non-gogle guy grab me a blaze rod and an iron block She wants me to do something for her What if I screw it up what if I Oh I feel lightheaded Wow Now I need an assistant to help with my assistant Think you can handle it on your own oh I forgot her task Oh no What did I What what do I have to put on i only listen to my task Olivia can you hear me i don't think that I've ever fainted before So embarrassing Everything working over fine I'll just do it myself then Oh damn She is a leader She is a power woman What come on Come on Come on Last time I saw command block it was trouble You're a big loser Trial number 6,451 Another bust Now about you three uh your friend here does she fall over frequently is this going to be a regular occurrence i No I'm sorry I was just so excited to And with me always pacing around lost in my own brilliant thoughts I could have tripped over you and conked my brain Brilliant thoughts gone I'm saying it See that i'm saying it I have to confess something Eligard We're not here to be your assistants Woo kind of glad actually What with Madam Faints a lot over there So why are you here we're actually here to get your help There's a giant wither storm and it's attacking the entire world A wither what what are you talking about her Who sent you was it Calvin i I say Ivor I say Ivor She probably wants to know about he's created a terrible monster Look you both seem like very pleasant people who are prone to fainting but I simply don't have the brain power for this What i'm in the middle of my greatest project to date A powerful block capable of altering reality itself I'm so close I can practically taste it And it tastes like victory Is she also insane of sweet sweet redstone engineering Let me help you Trying to make a command block Let me help you I'm going to sabotage Wait wait wait wait How do you know what a command block is not to seem belittling but we are talking about some mega ultra genius level stuff here This is what I've been trying to tell you The world needs the order of the stone That's why we're here Uh sorry to bust your circuits but the order isn't really together anymore We uh sort of disassembled huh that's actually kind of why we're here Gabriel's ambulance Why you showing that this certainly changes things Haven't seen one of these in a long time Now do you believe us so do you believe us now yes Okay This is serious indeed All the more reason why I need to finish my command block I can use it to fight this Withertorm monster thing or whatever Necessity is the originator of invention and that monster is my necessity for inventing of which I am the originator Don't you understand that sounds perfect I don't know if that was the correct one The wither storm problem was created by a command blocky Yes That means a command block could be the perfect way of beating it And maybe will you help me make one i don't know if she's lying bro It's going to work this time I can feel it right here in my brain She also seems crazy I hope too guys I don't know I don't know Help We do it What dude I don't know if we're creating another monster with her Maybe Gabriel is the only sane one left Okay we'll help her Okay you're the genius Eligard Let's get started Fantastic No going back Oh man I don't know man Oh what was [Music] [Music] that lapis Lously emeralds redstone [Music] What is she crafting what what are we that's not a Minecraft [Applause] [Music] Ah I did it Oh my god Crafting Crafting Crafting What oh my god What was that what i had no time Reuben please chill Chill The hell is she crafting is she dumb [Music] that has to be that time Okay Okay Excellent Good This is so exciting Terribly exciting Has it gotten this far before no Never Should we be happy about this is it destabilizing no Wait Wait Come on Got him That would have been easy if I didn't get that We need to go We need to get to the portal I'm so sorry So so sorry It's okay Round 07 [Music] redium the portal Hurry Get ready Now what oh no Over here Oh my This way Got it Jesse Got it What got it That thing will die today Okay let's hope that Axel and Lucas didn't do no stupid things I want them to have settled their beef because there are greater things that we have to worry about Wow Reaper Whoa Who goes there oh Jesse Lucas is that you just let us in Lucas I'm so glad you're back And we brought Eligard Where is Axi fantastic Jedi seems a little bit too happy for my liking You guys are never going to believe who showed up while you were gone Surely he didn't Hey Petra Hey guys how's it going oh my god Oh I'm so glad you're okay Petra Yeah I'm pretty stoked about it myself dude I'm so happy right now And it's really good to see you Jesse Hey guys back there in Gabriel's body Nervous right now not going to lie It got pretty dicey She a cutie It's such a relief to see you I'm glad you're okay You pulled me out of that wither storm's crutches and I ran and ran and ran for the temple If you hadn't saved me well I owe you everything Jesse I know I'm just glad I I know Trust me I know Let me make that louder heard Gabriel telling you where to go I'm so glad to see you Did anyone else get away were there any other survivors it's all a blur but the weather storm left almost nothing behind Nine Everything Everyone was just gone It even caught Gabriel What i wouldn't believe that anything could defeat Gabriel if I hadn't seen it for myself This is terrible Boy can't remember the last time I saw this place Would someone care to explain what he is doing here wait that's the TNT guy But do you two not like each other oh my Right I forgot to mention Axel went on a little adventure of his own while you were gone an adventure to get him Did you know about this why didn't you i told you Chad I told you you did this on purpose Everyone just coming and going around here Is that problem and this is a problem You bet it is I will not work with him What not after Well let's not talk about it Look just wait here a second while I figure out what's going on Much appreciated What happened to the Golden Order they're all Who are you then all right I don't trust this guy Why'd you bring the queen of the nerds with you that's Jesse my best friend I told you it's Brand TNT Refer Jesse's totally cool I'll uh I'll be the judge of that You two need to grab that along Yeah And you two are going to have to get along Okay We didn't even know you were going to be here That makes two of us then But reverse for me I got tired of waiting around so I decided to go recruit Magnus myself It was kind of a crazy adventure but it all worked out in the end And now I'm the king of Boom Town What we've been bonding and stuff I've had like the best day Boom Town That's the name of Magnus' kingdom I had to beat him in a crazy tournament Long story You had to be there Short bro Axel is dumb as hell Axel the type of guy to join a [ __ ] multi-leveling marketing course Boom town king G [ __ ] G Epic battle of explosions and mayhem Deathding action shenanigans and pyrochnics Bada bing Bada boom Your friend here is kind of supreme ruler of my kingdom now You know what I mean well this is unexpected I'm not entirely sure what you mean but I'm definitely sure that I don't like it Yeah show him some respect What you're sticking up for Magnus That's very sweet Yeah he's sticking up for me It's because I'm really awesome Stay out of it And super cool Axel not your fight Stay out of it But your friend has a point I can fight my own battles Uh people can we please focus on the bigger picture we have a very hungry wither storm in the process of turning the whole world into its dinner It was terrifying It came out of nowhere and just destroyed everything She's realizing little too scary for you Ellie Couldn't just think it away What are these egos bro i'm telling you this thing was like nothing I've ever seen Why because it's never come inside one of your little workshops Would you two stop fighting whoa Yikes I'm ready to kill the TNT guy Find some way to stop that thing Well I don't know if you've had the chance to poke around this old dump yet but it's pretty much stripped bare It would take a mountain of TNT to kill that thing I hate to say it but you have a point This is amazing I know Are they getting along i thought you were heroes You're members of the order You two can't handle this Whoa Give us a minute All right We just barely got here We'll get it But against such an unthinkable enemy even all the TNT in the world might not be enough Only Saurin were here He might have something we could use Oh Ellie not this again You know I hate when you brag about you and Saurin's little brainy club I'm not bragging I think I got a legitimate idea here What are you talking about what did Saurin have saurin had a kind of super TNT Stronger and more explosive than anything else in the world What the formidab bomb The [ __ ] yeah Yeah Yeah I've heard all about Fbomb before Fbomb Ah they mean [ __ ] Oh my god Jeez Louise Dropping the fbomb could destroy anything Uh but I've never seen it It's real I swear Uhhuh Do you know where it is can we get some well there's a little problem there We don't know where Saurin is But you found us Do you know where he is he ain't on the map Or is he our map could locate him unless he's in the Nether at the end but it's worth a shot He wasn't on the map but he may be in the [ __ ] Nether The Nether How are you Petra fine You okay we can talk about it later Let's just do this map for now All right I already know someone died I mean everyone died Well hello Ellard You said you know how to activate the map I'm very curious to see it I've never actually seen it work before dude Okay these guys are pissing me off these these so so-called heroes of the order Bro everyone has big egos She just wants to see how the red zone behind this works Like what the [ __ ] is happening bro the world is ending Everyone's dying Hey Magnus Hey small fry No shame in admitting you can't turn that thing on It's very very sophisticated I'm going I'm going I know what I'm Lucas How are you holding up Lucas i'm all right This has all been pretty intense I feel like if I think too much about what's been going on well I'll just think I'm completing this Thank you so much for all the help I I know we haven't always gotten along the best in the past but you've been so great Wow that means a lot Jesse Thank you No worries Chief No worries Sorry about that cookie Sorry about that cookie All right boys It's time What oh not this again Don't tell me you have to do the riddle again I'm going to snap Hey Olivia you okay huh i'm all right I can't shake the feeling that I embarrassed myself back in Redstone in front of Eligard Yo these guys are judges me a little bit It'll be okay The word is ending Everyone just worries about their [ __ ] egos Everything eh guys lock in What the [ __ ] is happening what please no Please no Thank god All right there's your light My light Did I skip talking to Axel on purpose or not you be the judge That's new There he is Saurin had his place deep inside the mountains after the order broke up That's where he went to keep doing his experiments Look he invited me there a couple times but it always seemed a little weird right it always seemed a little weird Glad we can agree on that At any rate I mean I never actually went there with him That's probably the only time you made the right I'm not a P word Let's stop hanging around here and go get us some super tea What no way Gabriel No way It didn't do that before Are you sure it's working blue Blue That's Ivor Wait what ivore is going to Saurin's We need to move Wait I forgot about Ivor Ivor is the really bad guy Probably make it on foot righteous We'll get some rest and head out first thing in the morning avoiding all the nighttime monsters and everything If you had seen that monster you wouldn't be saying that We need to leave now I think it's following us Magnus And I don't want to risk it catching up with us We have to go now It's so bad that you're going to just go walting out the woods at night Yeah I don't want the wither storm catching up with us We should go now An excellent call Jesse and far more decisive than either of us are being What a coincidence that it's your plan but fine I don't care if Magnus doesn't like me She's a griefer A infetted eagle griefer Okay everyone Let's get moving Oh god Yo we haven't really gotten a chance to chat yet Oh hello All right What's I heard you saved your friend back there from this wither storm thing You're pretty tough huh yes A regular iron golem huh leaving the creepers quaking in their boots Yeah I am pretty tough Looking for a fight Whoa Easy slugger You got mock I like that That's right Kind of wish you had my back before but whatever Still seem all right Is that's right Chad What's the deal with your buddy Axel no Can't tell if he's awesome or a little bit of a dork He's just a little uh doofy you know He's like a little puppy You don't know whether you want to hug it or just walk I have to keep it real I'll be honest He's been kind of annoying you lately Fighting all the negativity Yeah that's why he didn't listen to his plan to come with me I don't know if I should have picked that I meant it more like Axel like shouldn't have done the [ __ ] with you like you know like king of whatever You have that effect on people sometimes I figured that we needed brains to fight the wither storm and brains means elegard Yeah I I didn't try to backstab Chad I didn't I'll try not to let it hurt my feelings too much [ __ ] Well just keep on your toes Whoa At least no creeper Oh my god This is why I said we should have waited till morning We wouldn't need to worry about any of this crap At least we're keeping ahead of the wither storm Chicken jockey out later We got some monsters to fight here people Oh hell no It's time boys It's time Big fight incoming Okay here we go with the zombie slayer Um all right we can bow at the beginning Bang Oh shoot We have no more arrows All right time to lock in Time to lock in Bang There it is Bang There it is Don't take any damage here Bang Nice Easy Stawn swad OPG Nice They are two hit Go in Go in Go in Go in

really not feeling those columns Ah come on It's fine Look Woo Bro not Axel I swear Yo wait for the team Don't fall Okay Oh that is got this That is very very deep There it is There it is Got it What about Reuben whoa That was Oh no What that was impossible I swear Don't look at him Don't look at him We've got Enderman Just don't look at him Just don't look Oh my god Your voice and thought I would come down to help What that's actually holding someone's head There are so many I didn't think they ever came in groups that big [Music] Where the others where are the others they went searching ahead for you that's why Oh no Oh no Oh no Oh [ __ ] This reminds me of If you know you know MC driving Oh Whoa Whoa This ain't nice Uhoh Jump Jump Jump Michael Enderman are afraid of water apparently I wish I knew this a little bit earlier Oh be quiet It's just our point in this building That's all I'm saying I mean even our fighting ended up with the most That's it I'm going once again It falls to me to take care of everything I'll find this super TNT myself We leave for one minute No no no You do not get to be the one who walks away That's it I'm going See I'm walking away too Now TNT here I come guys It's hard to pick glass half full when they keep kicking the glass over Left seems right to me So well yeah I wouldn't go that far They've definitely got issues to work through But hopefully they'll work things out and get on with the important stuff What are we going to do now where should we go let's figure it out I trust the redstone lady a lot more Not going to lie But Axel is not going to Axel is going to go with Man Axel you're pissing me off Why are you like Why are you not with us bro [Music] i'm glad he came along Even if it did take a bit of persuading They made a statue of me I wouldn't choose that pose I'd look like this Oh my god What are we doing do I have to choose between Olivia and Axen please No This place is a dream come true for Lucas Look at him He's loving it I [ __ ] with Lucas Chad He was the only one to jump down for us Saurin the builder Magnus the rogue Eligard the engineer Gabriel the warrior [Music] Petra what's good hey Petra Hey you okay she needs a pork chop She needs She is not She's hungry Maybe let's eat Reuben Chad No chappa I'm just kidding Whoa whoa whoa Hey Jesse Yeah it's Petra She I don't know Doesn't seem right I tried asking but she [ __ ] Well maybe she'll talk to you And she did Okay I mean I guess it's time to choose boys I'm telling you it this is the right way Elegant It has to be right Magnus or Elegant chat the griefer or the redstone lady both biggest egos ever i don't know man Is it about who can help us the most who can actually [ __ ] like destroy the wither redstone versus TNT I mean we just need to find the super TNT Doesn't really matter Without Elegant we can't even get the super TNT to the wither She can build us a redstone cannon [Music] Why are you guys saying Magnus are you guys being uh how do you say it misogynistic What this guy is being a dick and you guys all say Magnus Why this is crazy right now Mods pull it up But I don't give me some reasoning why Magnus is not a deck But but and she is a what magnus Colson No you're just a sim She won't let you hit gang Yo nah I'm trying to save the [ __ ] world G I don't know what you guys are doing I We have to We have to Ah but our deep talk on the way here with Magnus was kind of like he he did seem to have the right intention and Axel is on his side feel like if we go elegant we also lose Axel but we may lose Olivia if we go um if we go Magnos Let me just look That didn't [Music] help Guys this is this is a really really hard decision Poll is up by the way pull this up I don't know if I will scam though If it's if it's close I'm just going to go with Elegard Not going to lie Big cool place like this underground Weird [ __ ] man What does the P say i I I would have to tab out I'm too lazy to tab out This super TNT thing feels like such a long shot What's percentage well we're trusting Elegard on this one so maybe our chances are better right elegard 65 W I I think I agree I think I agree The TNT guy seems like a creep He's a griefer Petra are you okay i'm sorry I don't mean to worry you I've just got something I want to discuss with you in private Oh no But let's split up What is it whoa I feel bad about ditching everyone else but I just wanted to talk to you about this alone It's a little tough to talk about Axel can get a little explody sometimes Hey whatever it is I trust you You can tell me Thanks for being so understanding Of course Of course You got me away from the wither storm but I'm worried that I didn't get away soon enough What infected oh hell no It showed up not too long after you saved me What is that what's wrong with your arm do you know what wither is the wither of course We've been No Jesse just wither or wither sickness I guess Oh no And I feel like it's just going to keep getting worse Well we're going to go back and tell the others we can get help You can't tell anyone about this Ah creeper What the [ __ ] grab my can Pull you up Got it I got it Jesse I just couldn't I'm sorry Wait Because of the wither hand She didn't have any power on it Are you okay [Music] go and find the others Hopefully you can find a way to get down to me or something Okay I got

like a torch W I'm kind of scared of a chicken jockey Looks fine though Oh I saw something though Let me go here Watch out for pressure plates What is this bit something is going to happen in a second

Jesse did anyway False You have stopped nothing You can't Have you ever seen the effects of a splash potion of slowness no Are you talking about what no You bet No Magnus and Eligard may think they can stop me that they can destroy the wither storm but they are mistaken and it will cost them their lives Bro potions are [ __ ] OP man This is what next time on M No you don't Does this count as an anime loki one of my favorites together with Skippy toilet [Music] No stop him Hurry Uh come back and fight His ego's back and fight What move out of the way What are you doing jeep us Everyone okay i felt all of that That was one heck of a landing Axel mostly used his face Oh my god We need to find Saurin Yeah Where's TNT and where's red zone i still can't figure out how Ivore made the door close Oh [ __ ] Maybe we should focus more on how it opens That's basically what I said guys Sure Maybe it was a pressure plate You don't look so good But like I said [ __ ] Thanks man I didn't mean it like that I know Oh no She's She made Look at this She's looking really bad I'm not trying to freak you out but I'm a little bit freaked out right now It's starting to feel stiff And my vision's all

to hold off on the grammar lessons until later Which way are we headed Jesse what no because when the end it doesn't work Only the over works Stuff like that doesn't work in the Nether Probably not the end either Chad I feel so bad Look at her face Great man She's about to die So we were trapped and now we're lost So we go from uh a death machine that almost drowns us and we land here in the end which is the right name for a master Incredibly we don't even know where we're going This guy stayed No I'm saying we should have known where we were headed before we left We do know where we're going Towards Saurin That's enough Judah face it Jesse We might never find this guy There he is bro Did that just happen i can't believe that just happened Am I the only one that's surprised because that was I mean that was like we conjured him Where is he going only one way to find out We got to go Everyone follow me I'll get us to the other side Oh no Chad She wants to sacrifice Stay behind me and we'll we'll be fine Ali it's all right I'll go first Actually you know what i'll just go What give me a chance Just say the word Wait did it say she's going first i didn't read that right Um I wouldn't mind sacrificing Lucas This guy is being a bum recently Like he's trying to troll for his like reputation Like who are you trolling bro like what the hell are you doing G you want to go first all right do it then But he does look kind of scared Look at his voice I know that I got it though That's the thing I'll take over the team as always It is what it is Whether he likes it or not he will cry about He will be \"No let me go Everyone follow me It's me It's me.\" But I Yep buddy Trust me you're doing your job Do not look at the Enderman Do not look Don't look at the Enderman Oh man Oh man I'm getting flashbacks I'm getting [ __ ] flashbacks All right so the Ender Dragon is slain You're really getting the hang of this Jesse That was kind of semi partially a little bit cool Thanks Thank you All that matters is we made it Piss guy Yep And the dragon is slain Pistons It's kind of sus Go They could retract Well [ __ ] it Careful for Enderman But it looks clear It looks clear I would do anything for Nutra I hope that someday I love something as much as Saurin seems to love stairs [ __ ] Look how slow she gets Can you give me a sec no Oh no I'm going to call her She's going to No Real quick Need a hand no no I can manage Thanks Really i'm fine I'm good I'm good We can keep moving But you're not Who are you trolling what so many stairs There's a ladder You serious right now better not be a long one Drink a redstone while lock in man Looks like that's the way in After you dude Here it goes Okay lock in Why you kind of build like Axel thank you bro Chad am I too silent i didn't see any lull about my joke When they were sitting on the floor I said \"Drink a red stone bull and continue redstone bull because red bull.\" But I didn't see any loyalty I think the game is too loud You didn't hear it Or what what do you see i don't know Oh it looks beautiful Please don't say more stairs I don't see Saurin Well I don't see Saurin but you guys aren't going to believe what's up here What is this this script Green grass trees a huge lake I've played these games before Come and see for yourselves So bright True man show I'm getting so many different impressions right now [Music] That's my body Axel My broken battered body Second Wait it's wool It's The ground is almost squishy This doesn't look like a normal tree Funny too It's all fake Hey I can see it again What in the It's made of wool This tree the grass it's it's all wool Who would do this you're telling me that we've been resting all our hopes on this guy and the whole time he's been building some totally artificial happy land well it's real wool It's real evidence that Saurin is whacked Could it be that he just missed home if you miss home you go and visit You don't build an exact replica We came here for nothing Whoa What are we even supposed to do now we came here for Saurin and for his formidabomb That's still the plan Just look around Jesse If the greatest builder of all time has spent years working on this what are the chances he's even going to have that bomb huh i've got enough crazy for one day This guy what's his problem he seems pretty upset Maybe he's allergic to wool I'm going to keep it a buck He's being a jerk Don't worry about him He's just being a jerk Come on Hey it is what it is It's It's right It's correct Pull your group together and find a way out All right Hey Petra [ __ ] So on a scale of uh to how bad are you feeling somewhere in between but I'm holding on for now How do you think Saurin managed to get out of here without leaving any clues behind he is the greatest builder of all time If anybody knew how to put in the secretest of secret doors it's him So I'm probably looking for Well to open a secret door you need a secret mechanism Brush up lead I guess I'm going to keep looking around Look away A Is that a zombie lever Whoa That was easy [Music] Neat I saw a button on the wall Let me pet Ruben Haven't patted it in a bit My goat Love you G You like that don't you boy we got this bro We got this Trust me Hey Reuben Is he looking at a fake pig i know I'm supposed to be looking for something Reuben any idea what what's that boy you see something over there you doing okay buddy high five Reuben My guy Well I'm going to keep looking boss This fake pig Thought you could trick me huh fake son Well it's not going to work What's up Jesse think I'm on to something with this lever puzzle If I can just find the secret door I know it's going to open Okay we got this I'm going to keep poking around Right Well there it is What I listen to sounds like the music is coming through the wall What looks kind of like clouds made out of glass We should light those bad boys up All of them GG Didn't do anything Sure about that saw it chat I saw it Another switch Cool There it is Just a couple more The question is where's the rest something over there First time made of wool Bro's questioning the redstone build because there's no redstone coming out Fast time chatter Yeah L movie bro L game doesn't even work like that Number one redstone on the chat What is What are you doing Lucas what do you want what what what's your problem Lucas listen I know I've been prickly okay but Jesse I think something's wrong with Petra No [ __ ] I mean you have to have noticed the lack of energy the labored breathing I I wish I could tell you but I'm not supposed to talk about it Wait Talk about what jesse if I'm right about this you have to tell me It's not fooling anybody I don't see a reason to hide it too Chad Like that's not me She said not to panic anyone but like maybe he's got an idea Maybe he had someone like who had this before like with a sickness I don't even even Petra is going to be mad at me Hey what is she going to die mad at me like sick Like I want to save her How long have you known a while But she asked me not to say anything The wither infected her with something So everything I was worried about is true This is my fault Jesse Okay Okay Maybe it was a mistake Shy sir Now we have two people Petra's wither sickness It's because of me It's not your fault There's no way this is because of you If I hadn't choked you would have been able to pull Petra out of that tractor beam sooner For all we know Petra didn't get sick in way after that Time out How my scum friend for telling Lucas that that she's sick Petra said \"Don't announce it because people will feel bad for me and like you know like the the mission will get like will get harder.\" I'm not letting down Petra with this Like what is she going to like die like this nine I wanted to be saved Addressing it may get her saved She trusted you Yes but bro it's her ego above it She wants to save the world then save herself But we can do both Do we even stand a chance and not like we haven't dealt with some grade a problems before but I just can't help feeling kind of hopeless I know things look bad but I still believe Saurin's our best hope Once we find him things will look better Facts Did they surely he's not going to be another useless [ __ ] order person Well okay I just kind of wish Petra would tell everybody It would just make things easier [ __ ] Let me push that [ __ ] lever Yo can you move hey Jesse I kind of need to get at that lever you're blocking There it is There it is Open the NAR Thanks Yep Okay What does that do now what does that mean it's uh cute I guess What is this what is that there's a button Where the one at the wall Where's a button what button like where the guys are didn't those just activate some lights under the lights oh yeah This one Wait Wool zombie I want to know the law behind this wool zombie chat Give me one second [Music] Really that is crazy Low key All right let's go Let's go Can I go up that le lever the ladder probably not Let's push that [ __ ] Whoa that's weird Hey everyone I think I found Saurin's way out Way to go Jesse That's awesome Thank you Nice sleuththing Jesse Bro sorry I wasn't more help back there when I think back to how I ran all over Endercon looking for Ivore or when I got that skull It's hard to imagine I did any of that now that I'm like this Don't even worry about it Petra And don't apologize [ __ ] I uh Thanks How can we help her how can we How can we save her we'll check out the rest of the house Milk See if we can find Saurin before he finds us The potion Maybe Maybe Ivor can help us with the potion Like I don't [ __ ] know man Like a vitality potion Like regeneration Guess the water system isn't just for the outside Not that the outside was actually the outside A gapple maybe Yeah [ __ ] man There some banners on the wall Interesting seating area You could fit hundreds of people in here but doesn't look like it's being used for much of anything Hundreds is crazy What's this music well the music's louder but I don't hear anyone talking in there Let's see what's going on behind this door Careful Careful Could be anything behind there Maybe even a chicken jockey [Music] Why are we sneaking and I call that one symphony in E A new composition to celebrate my newest discovery That's him This time I observe place a block on top of another block What the rudimentary yes but it's just a recording Undeniable intelligence I hope I'm not imagining things Good thing after all that He's not even here I better eat something positively lightheaded with excitement We came all this way And for what we're no closer to Saurin than before We can't give up now Saurin had to have been here at some point Facts Which means this place has got to be crawling with clues Odds are it's crawling with something Maybe there's something useful on this record Whether they might be able to be persuaded to build collaboratively Dude I just want to loot those chests in the back I'm going to keep it up Simple building instructions to inspire them I will disguise myself and hide among them in order to observe them more closely Huh hide among hide among who uh Jesse do you think Saurin is talking about them what oh no Then again he's not a furry He's a He's a Ender or something Wait no way That's what he means Nuts dude Even the armor stand is having he's trying to get them to build an enderman skin You think he's actually training he's trying to become one of them stuff I think he thinks he's training Enderman to build stuff Let's look around See what we could find out Oh sheesh Sheesh Look Enderman suit This is his Endor sona Olivia check it out an Enderman suit Either Saurin's got a very unique fashion sense or wait a second This must be the disguise Saurin was talking about on the recording In order to walk amongst the Enderman you have to become an Enderman It smell like one apparently Woof What I mean put that [ __ ] on Put that [ __ ] on now and go inside Put that bad boy on Put that bad boy on Oh it is time to become a [ __ ] And I look stupid as hell I kind of stinky but it fits I look like Batman More than kind of stinky I'm sorry to say It's so weird I know it's you in there but I still don't want to look at you Yeah because I'm an Enderman I need a pumpkin head If you know Minecraft then you understand Ooh hold up and nine Found something What you got Riddle it's definitely some sort of crafting recipe But why would someone as brilliant as Saurin need a recipe for a shape that simple what is that because they're not for Saurin They're for the Enderman This must be what he's trying to teach them to build Six clay blocks So if Saurin is using those blueprints to teach the Enderman to build and there's a disguise missing from the stand He must be conducting his experiment right now Of course the missing disguise is the one he had to put on before going outside Which means if we want to get to Saurin we have to go out there to do it Hold up I'm no art snob but you know that's really creepy right huh the Ender suit I keep wanting to not look at you It's so disturbing I'm sorry You go ahead and build with those Enderman outside I'll just wait here Are we Did you check the chest are we ready for this oh whoa whoa What is this wait Those instructions called for clay blocks just like this one One out of How many was it one four six Let's go up Any clay blocks it's a good thing they can't see me through this glass What is that over there what is that over there that's That's it Clay block I'll take this one too That's where we need to place them Two Where would the other clay blocks be i have no idea I have no idea Let's go down here Bada bing bada bang Okay Huh that's three I've grabbed so far Did I grab that one already lol I see it Oh my god these guys are hidden as hell Reuben you find anything useful worth asking It's okay No worries Chi Just hang on a second Saurin in disguise looks like any old Enderman And so will you How are you going to find him walk up to every Enderman out there and say \"Hey are you Saurin?\" She's right though The whole point of the disguise is to avoid that kind of attention i'll be smart We uh just need to get his attention without ringing up the Enderman Try not to die Okay I'd really hate to have to watch that from behind this protective glass Chad thanks for the vote of confidence We are smart We got this Okay we've just got to get Saurin's attention Lock in and avoid attracting theirs Lock in If you see an enderman man that doesn't look like an ender Oh one of [Music] you Oh my gosh Jesus Wait I saw clay block He's holding a clay block I need that my guy I need that my geyser Wait that's Saurin over there Never seen a baby enderman guys I have never seen a baby enderman That's all I'm going to say Let me get that Let me get that Let me get that G please Let me get that Yep Take another block Take a wool block Take a wool block Guys that's Zoran No this guy right here It's a Is this a baby we need one more clay block We need one more clay block Looks like building Let me just take another look at the instructions Nothing I can't handle I don't have water I do not have water Chat we can place some One block down five to go I just hope that Saurin's watching wherever he is Surin please I need your last block See what I'm doing here chat if you look at the [ __ ] map that's everything I've got Guess I got to find another block We need one more We need one more Y l Where could the last block be where could that last block be i have no Is that clay no Oh that's Oh Uh where could that last block be where could it be inside somewhere Must be It must be Hate going back but it must be somewhere outside Inside Chad Did you see any other block cracked it yet not yet but I'm getting closer Where is that last [ __ ] block i'm going to snap in a second here Clay clay clay What is this totemic constructions of peaceful Enderman h Could Enderman be implored oh hell no Work together Give me a song Give me C418 Enderman observations part 27 I have been watching the Enderman up close today and I'm convinced that I may have caught them communicating or at the very least two of them stood near each other for an extended time Looks like this is the last block in here Was very exciting Then they wandered away but it seemed deliberate Maybe I followed one of them for the next 3 hours Here's what happened Yo this guy is a weirdo Can I say it like what or is it like an animal observer calls of the Enderman He's dressing up as a lion like and then trying to This is kind of weird though [Music] Okay let's try this again And finally an Enderman love song [Music] It's all just fascinating Yo he is losing it just like every other one Here we go False evidence of Enderman intelligence accomplished Nothing to see here guys Just walk away Okay they're not walking away Definitely not walking away Oh no I am sorry about this but it has to look real What i I don't think it'll bruise your face I These suits were built with durability in mind You must be Saurin Well I am but must I be i'm not sure if I want to sometimes What sometimes I'd prefer to be anything but Saurin Like a donkey for example You have to help me I just did You hit me hard in the face You upset the Enderman and I got you to safety By the way as far as introductions are concerned this is not going very well We're in danger Oh what else is new whatever your issue is whatever your problem it has occurred before and has been solved before Even so what do you need me for i've gone out of my way to avoid these types of problems I don't even remember what it looks like up there Help me save the world How the Formida bomb There's a wither storm on the loose and it's eating the world Ah I see You misspoke You don't need me You need my stuff Oh hell no Chad the problem is he doesn't care He's living in the end He's not realizing any of this on the overworld I found that it's like he's living on the moon and the world is going down He doesn't care right now He's built his own life over here When you give people what they want they turn on you What they become resentful They show their true colors I won't do that It's only natural It's why I prefer Enderman They always do what you expect almost to a fault You're a stranger and what you're asking for is too dangerous I have a pig I don't know why I was wondering about that My guess is portable meal What he's my friend Of course I used to have those Gabriel asked me to reassemble the Order of the Stone The Order of the Stone They asked for me Yes I've always known they needed me but I was never sure if they wanted me Uh it's lonely down here without your friends Gabriel is your friend I don't know H I don't know Does he ever talk about me uh sure Uh what kinds of things do they say specifically give me an example They've missed you that you were missed Really Maybe it was more missing You have to read between the lines Yes Yes you do But what about you are you my friend yes As long as we're on the subject Not to put you on the spot Yes Sure That's the best thing I've heard in years Admittedly it's not a very high bar Bro don't worry I'm going to help you because that's what friends do I like this guy Before we leave I'm going to give my old friends a gift The gift of song Oh no that music La Gary may seem scary but he's a swell guy Sally dillydallys Give her credit she tries They might look the same to the untrained eye but that's a lie Let it play So I say hey wait is that are are are you Saurin whoa Nice to meet you Saurin Oh no you look terrible She's right [Music] Wait Seems a bit odd They've never been inside before What's happening what you've upset them You've altered their behavior Okay let's go What the [ __ ] did we do and the hits just keep on coming I wasn't expecting so many house guests There's no way I have enough seashell soaps for all of them Yo we need six endo suits How are we supposed to get out of here we need to come up with a plan And not our usual We'll come up with a plan when we have to Let's break that fountain Back in the maze when we fell into the water the Enderman didn't follow us Well naturally Enderman hate water Oh if we could force the fountain to overflow somehow Jesse you still have the Enderman suit Put that on and you'll be able to safely reach the fountain Y just when I thought I'd never have to smell this thing again Good luck dude We'll um I'll watch from here then where it's safe It's okay It's okay It's okay It's good It's great It's good Try not to die Thanks Jeep Very helpful [Music] Come on What are you waiting for the plan was to break the fountain Oh yes There it is There it is They don't like water Look at them guys Go get them [Music] Oh no Are you serious right now we're going to die Nobody's going to die because I'm going to break the other mountain Oh it's thirsty Whoa Why fountain number two Prepare to meet your doom Wait they realized that I'm not one of them Okay everybody let's go I stand in the water I end the man smarter than pigs What's the hold up guys no Shots everywhere How are we supposed to get through this oh my god I mean physically and psychologically Eyes down everyone I don't care Say we somehow make it Keep your eyes down everyone Grab on to me Like these guys act like they can't look down I guess if this is the only way we're going to make it back to the trap door Lock in Lock in Eyes down Oh he's down Eyes down [Music] [Music] everyone Maybe we should uh turn around What or not don't look Don't look I'm one of you guys Guys right in my face One of you guys I'm I'm an Enderman Wait in the water Water Water Water Water Water Water Yeah Oh when I constructed this place I worried about how flammable my building material was So I installed a fire suppression system to prevent the whole thing from going up in flames So there's more water Put it on Put it on Much more If we activate it it could disperse all these Enderman while we swim to safety Can we reach the controls from here the lever It's right up there bro Yesesh huh i don't know how much water this thing is going to kick out So everybody Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa You're that sick of [ __ ] It's working Well done Jesse Now time to swim to that trap door Quick come on Hurry Go go go go go Keep swimming Uh-oh Uh-oh We're going to drown if we don't make it in time Keep going Keep going guys Oh [ __ ] Oh no Look at our bubbles Look at

here One small problem I need sleep Why do we all have iron bombs why does no one have lack i haven't actually built it yet That's a small problem You seem like a person who appreciates cool stuff that's cool for no reason Go ahead and throw that lever behind you Jesse lover hold on to your socks cuz they're about to get blown off Go to work boys Baby girl God damn Holy holy [ __ ] Oh that did turn out to be pretty cool You know well I wouldn't lie to you Jesse Oh no Wait a minute I would I didn't lie to you That's what I All right we got to keep that in mind You would lie to us this guy Do you guys hear that so what shake all that stuff whispering Take me Take me now Damn So he built the space He's saying he's the master You should get to take more than Axel But why because she's cooler N Come on Loot I thought you and me were tight I know this is cool but the only things we need in here are the ingredients for the formidab The loot says you're wrong Awesome I'll just fetch the super TNT Some loot would be nice It's right up there Maybe I [ __ ] up How are you going to get up there i have my ways What yo who is this guy oh and feel free to help yourselves Chad Just make sure you keep an eye out for the gunpowder we'll need to make that formidable Out of the order guys he's the coolest together with Gabriel Like by far The other guys were scumbags Oh this guy is the [ __ ] What did I get gunpowder Gunpowder Not bad I wouldn't mind some netherite I'm going to keep it a bug I wouldn't mind some netherite It would be really handy to have glowstone dust but it would be so cool to finally have my very own spider eye Big decision I'll leave you to it Both useless Well oh no I see it See anything you want Reuben just because everyone else is grabbing stuff doesn't mean you have to too Diamonds It's just from the mob far I'm stupid It can't be anything crazy Gunpowder Gunpowder Gunpowder Gunpowder How much do we have eight gunpowder we have chat Oh I don't know if I should push that Well guess what let's find out That's good Cool Hey Saurin Jesse I think I've got almost enough gunpowder now Glad to hear it And Jesse I am sorry for not keeping this place as organized as I should It's very embarrassing And this is my super TNT Oh wait But I My days pops wet dream Thought super TNT was the formidab bomb Of course not They're two completely different words aren't they build it Let's build us a Formida bomb Yes let's build away Build that bomb now How do we build us a Formida bomb exactly Let me guess Gunpowder Do we just combine this with the gun well the crafting recipe is quite simple really Super TNT in the middle and gunpowder all around I hate Got it No no no no The ingredients are highly unstable Even putting them in close proximity to each other is a risk Okay well we may not have the bomb yet but at least we finally have the ingredients to build one Progress And now that we have them we We we I literally don't remember You're going to have to help me out a little Jesse Uh looking for any information here Still going to need Magnus and Eligard to use this thing They must be close Actually I don't know if that's the right idea Oh Oh dear Oh I was afraid of this With the end underwater the Enderman will try to escape Maybe we should leave before any of them show up Of course Of course To the mine carts everyone [ __ ] Should I have said that ages to say that to people I mean okay It's nice to do it all together Well we out [ __ ] We out Show Uh-oh Uh-oh Jeez Louise Jeez Incoming [Music] Wait what there you are So glad you

Oh no Feel like that got bigger No it did It's permittabomb time Wait is this the end no it's him It's you Hello old friends Jet we dropped the formidable bomb We have the gunpowder It's time to go We have the We only get one shot Remember once the formida bomb is crafted it'll explode in a matter of seconds It means whoever is doing the crafting will be in great danger Oh [ __ ] I was hoping Well

condemning them to death Oh stop staring and get a move on Well I can't just abandon them Not after a lifetime of study Chad your head's going to for him and the men are everything It's like I can't say it but forget about be abandoning your body if you don't turn around and run Jesse they're falling behind Axel you got to move faster She's too sick This is the best we can do Oh no They're not going to be able to outrun it Not on foot Do we leave her behind way to move faster but we're all going to be caught in the tractor beam Oh [ __ ] Sorry Right now I need to lock in again I I can't take this decision like so loosely right now with no time We need a minecart We have to help them Let's build a portal I will not pause anymore This is considered cheating right oh my god Shy This is the last one where I can take a breather Do we leave her behind that is the question He's about to She's about to die because of wither sickness But can we somehow survive a a [ __ ] rescue her maybe a gapple Maybe milk Build a portal We have to help them We need a minecart Low key A portal is a play Can we build a portal if somebody has the right materials I will not pause anymore We don't I haven't seen obsidian since the end Wait We'll have to use the next best thing I just saw a horse Everybody get on Already settled up Slow down Horus Bang Got it Hey what about us come on Jesse We got this Uhoh We'll take the reinss and they can just hang on Uh [ __ ] I've got Petra You take Gabriel No I wanted Petra Hold on This might be a bumpy ride Sorry I I don't know Wait we got Petra [ __ ] Chad I'm too slow Come on horses This is correct though I like this Whatever you do don't look back I look Lock in Mark look in Everyone follow me Oh no Got to avoid the creepers Oh Jesse to the left I don't like this I can't go further to the left Stop backseat steering Chicken jockey Can't help it I'm getting horse sick Wait Actual chicken jockey Actual chicken jockey Chicken jockey Hold cinema Go straight Ch He's gaining on us No offense but you could use a little practice First time on a horse here Watch it Back Got it You try to knock me off this thing Jesse Sorry Oh god Oh I turn around to see if it's gaining but it's all I can do to hold on Got it Got it Oh my god I wasn't ready for that Got it Right Got it Right Got it Shoot There We need to ride over that bridge Oh no Jesse look out Wait Enderman they're slowing it down Am I seeing Enderman attack destroying it Enderman move blocks It's what they do guys Come on We got to build a new one like right now Come on faster Hurry up We need more blocks Hurry up I got some Got to way more Enderman We need to connect the end to the overworld That's where Enderman's born Actually you're screaming in my ear Sorry [Music] We made it We actually freaking made it Jesse Gabriel was saying some pretty weird stuff back on that horse What he might have wither sickness I don't know You never acted the way he's been acting I'll go talk to him Hey how are you feeling i I'm afraid I don't feel much like myself at the moment Gabriel It really is you Oh I knew if anybody could outrun death it would be you Who are you people a It's me Eligard Come on Old friend Don't you recognize us it's Saurin We've known each other for a very long time time The wither storm did something to him You mean that thing we just rode on no that was a horse The hell what a terrible turn of events You did he have a schllock on fire you're the one who rescued me Tell me please what is going on i remember only blackness And then suddenly you were there You were caught in the withertorm trapped For how long long enough that it did this to you [Music] It felt like an eternity Oh no It was dark and foul and I was sure I was a goner Well you aren't You made it back alive which is more than I can say for some of us Magnus for a second there I almost managed to forget You guys talking about Magnus i still can't believe he's gone How How could this have happened to lose not just a friend but a member of the Order of the Stone All I know is he'd want us to keep fighting no matter what And for us to keep blowing the crap out of stuff You're right He would Ah being emotional is getting us nowhere What I want to know is what happened out there today Why is that thing still alive good question My instructions were simple You were the one in the middle of everything What went wrong it failed The formidab bomb just wasn't strong enough I mean it ripped the withertorm apart but it didn't make a dent in the command block So the command block is still out there Of course it is Oh great And now to make matters worse we've gone from one weather storm to three Our plan was a total failure I should have cast the foul thing into the abyss Why didn't I destroy that cursed block ages ago look our plan didn't work So we obviously need a new one The question is what do we do enderman why are you asking me endor Am I expected to know every last thing in the universe i need a moment to think Is he always like this you have no idea That jacket I recognize it Lucas always wears that jacket No there were other people wearing that very same jacket when I was thrown from the monster It hurts just to think about Wait just put it out of your mind What does that mean Jesse if what Gabriel said is true I mean do you think I thought for sure they were gone but if they were just trapped in the wither storm Lucas your friends could still be out there I know And that means I I got to go after them Oh why did I say they might need me Jesse oh no Whoa man [ __ ] those bums Those guys were [ __ ] snobs Those guys were pieces of [ __ ] They called us losers all day [ __ ] those guys Dizzy Easy easy I got you Reuben Talk to Hey buddy You doing okay a of course you are Wish I could say the same for everyone else [Music] Lucas what are you doing i told you I'm going after my friends I thought the other ocelots were dead but if they're not I need to go find them Look I am grateful to you guys for bringing me this far but I can't leave them alone out there Three wither storms raging You can't just up and leave Lucas You're part of our team And you saying that just reminds me that I left my team Oh my god Look you and me we've made a pretty good team so far I'd even call us friends So I hope you'll understand why I need to go help my old friends They do it for me Same way you'd go back for any of your friends But we are helping them Saving the world saves them too Isn't that just Yes we convinced them Kind of abstract Oh my god The number one thing you can do for them is to make sure we defeat those wither storms I I guess you got a point Okay I'll stay I just I just really hope they're all right Thanks Easily I'm going to go check on the horses I mean it is true though All right let me get this loot Some leftover cobblestone Not bad Not bad [Music] Horseies Am I glad you came along a just don't tell rude Chad horse have a very unique smell They might get jealous Do you like horsemen or no be honest How are the horses looking tired but they're okay Yeah same as the rest of us Well I'm glad you're staying with us Lucas Yeah me too W Uhoh Holy [ __ ] [ __ ] Look Saurin I said I needed some space Jesse Actually you said you needed time to think huh so did you think of anything oh my god Not really I'll let you know if I do That is so toxic Jesus Hidden loot on the left Hidden loot on the left Hidden loot on [Music] the Wait where's Petra petron Gabriel Can I go up here no How am I tweaking yeah I [Music] can't E your [Music] cabin Let's go back inside Must have missed [Music] something Aha Not going to lie but we've dealt with worse right have we how's it going tell me Jesse who is this person she keeps insulting me One minute I think I'm talking to a friend the next I'm being made fun of Order is a member of the Order of the Stone Does he know the Order of the What now no The Order of the Stone It's the greatest band of heroes ever assembled It's all gone And how do I know her exactly i sense we have a history but I feel I need a little reminder You guys defeated the Ender Dragon together the most fearsome creature this land has ever seen Really yeah really You're kind of a big deal It isn't working He doesn't remember anything Talk to him about your past Something only you would know about H like what j this is actually scary What like maybe a little bit too deep right now but Alzheimer's it's so scary No I swear on God man Because I had someone like of a friend that that had it and bro it is it is a [ __ ] weirdness It is very sad Very [ __ ] sad man We haven't seen each other for so long Uh I don't know what would even help Sh Sorry I need time to think I was think Ender Dragon Order Magnus The order Tell him more about the order Who you guys were how you got together anything No more pauses Well we came together because we loved adventure and we split apart because it doesn't matter now Tell us But in between we did some amazing things together Amazing I tell you We used to think we were invincible And perhaps we were That's true Thank you for sharing that with me And Jesse thank you too You've been a big help here I uh I need to repay your kindness I love him I'm not sure how He's the nicest guy in this group but I want to express my gratitude You can thank me by watching out for me and my friends This fight isn't over yet Very cool guy Very well Now then tell me more about this order of the star Sea salt I need you sea salt Sea salt Am I getting hacked i need you sea salt What what does that mean i don't get it Own I'm not even sure where to start [Music] [ __ ] Crap Oh no Petra how are you doing [ __ ] you look terrible Petra Your skin is like almost gray Hey way to not sugarcoat it I feel even worse than I look man If it wasn't for Ivore she wouldn't even be like this No kidding That's not exactly true Tell them Ivore built the wither Sure but he couldn't have done it without that skull I gave him [ __ ] she's right I didn't even think about that A second to think about it but all I cared about was getting that stupid diamond There's no way you could have known what would happen No one's ever seen anything like this Still I'm going to do everything I can to make this right Low key it was dumb as hell Bro what else do you use a wither head for in the Minecraft universe it's like in our world selling [ __ ] plutonium to a random guy on the street for a diamond Hello Petra I know this isn't easy to shoot Like what are we doing but you're too sick to be going anywhere I'm not that sick Maybe you should rest in this cave for a while I mean it's safe defensible If I say I'm fine then I'm fine If you try to keep going I'm afraid she doesn't want to admit it Make it No No way I'm not afraid I think she'll go with us Saying you are We can't leave her alone You need to keep fighting There's no time to sit around relaxing in some cave Is that crazy i don't know Thanks Jesse Knew you'd understand Just give me a little time to catch my breath and I'll be fine This is a bad idea Jesse Yeah well it's Petra's call to make Oh [ __ ] Okay I [ __ ] up Sorry Reuben I don't really feel like company Oh my god I'm going to cry Reuben Not [Music] again [ __ ] The team is falling apart The wither is ruling the world and it's stronger than ever with two more heads Our only plan failed Petra may die Gabriel lost his mind Petra are you sure you're okay i'm fine Jesse I just need to rest for a bit [ __ ] Let me see what Reuben is doing Reuben [Music] what where did Where did the builder go don't run off on me like that Okay [Music] I hope Gabriel will be okay I mean he's supposed to be Gabriel the warrior but instead he's saw Was that crazy yeah I guess none of the order are how we imagine them Like he knows Chad I don't have to like say it He knows that I like he's my everything The world needs us Reuben So much of it has already been reduced to bedrock and it's up to us to save the rest of it Oh uh well maybe that is a lot of pressure for just a person and a pig But we have to find a way That's what I said isn't it oh just as you once helped us before this isn't about the past It's about the future No there are three of those things now Wait You say that like it's my fault He's talking I'll take respons with the guy with the scammer The guy who created it I did that by locking the command block away So only you could use it Ah do you still not realize how dangerous it is oh the bitter irony Saurin the architect I do not need lectures from you That's debatable bro I [ __ ] hate irony Surin you need to listen to me He is the evilst guy in those worlds What good has ever come of that [Music] would you both stop arguing please oh no This isn't an argument It's me trying to make Ivor leave us alone I told you I wouldn't have followed you here without good reason Do we need his help does he have good intention at the end of the you don't understand is the thing is he is just this high school boy who wants [ __ ] he wants clout He saw everyone else from the order getting the recognition He got pushed outside of the group and that made him go insane He created a beast that he wanted to fight himself He had a potion for it in place We swapped out the potion All of a sudden now there's this big beast taking over the world He just wanted a token of recognition Does he have a good heart yes or no you are all in very grave danger [Music] Obviously I don't know No I mean specifically this group The weather storm isn't acting randomly It's following Gabriel What gabriel you see I may have programmed it to follow his amulet You mean the orders amulet yes Saurin That amulet That explains why the Wither Storm's been following us I don't understand Gabriel only just Why did I say that i have the amulet Ivor I have all along Why did I say that i I didn't [Music] know Ivore you fool You've created a monster that's following Jesse and it's only getting stronger You don't think I realize that nothing can stop those things Nothing even hurts them Well except Enderman Enderman Jesse's right The Wither's gaze passed over them and they went wild If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes do you think Enderman could actually destroy one of those things well it's not beyond imagination If there were enough of them working together it's a promising concept At least in theory if I'm seeing all the pieces correctly But to actually destroy a withertorm we'd need hundreds of them Thousands There's probably more than enough of them taking refuge in my fortress No way An unintended side effect of you flooding the end This is just like the old days Saurin You and your crazy ideas Ivore for once Question is how to bring the Storms and the Enderman together Enderman aren't pets They don't follow orders At least not from mere mortals We know for a fact the Wither Storm will follow the amulet So if we take the amulet back to your fortress where the Enderman are Yes Yes that's it We'll lead them straight into a massive trap Follow me If we can't bring the Enderman to the wither storms we bring the Wither Storms to the Enderman Just one problem You're forgetting about the command block Yes it's clear now that no weapon can destroy it Not even a Formida bomb through But what about the potion i may have a solution to that You see when I first took possession of the command block you mean stole it yes Well I created a fail safe a backup plan just in case Well I'd say just in case is here And I'm inclined to agree Are you saying you know how to destroy the command block i'm saying there might be a way What way an enchanting book One that contains the power of the command block itself Use it to enchant a weapon and you'll be able to smash the command block to bits forever Yes Yes that's it It could very well solve all our problems What are we waiting for let's go get that book Just one problem It's at my So was that Steve Aoki question mark secret lab which is sort of far away how far could it possibly be let's just say it's the farthest place a person can travel before being utterly Uh-oh Uh-oh Oh dear What was that oh my Hey we need maybe millions of Enderman Let's keep it a buck I can't believe it found us so quickly We're not safe anywhere are we well we can't stand around and wait for it So what do we do we need to get out of here right now Ivor says that if we don't that thing will Well I'll be It is you A pleasure as always Eligard Hello My name is Gabriel Oh somebody pinch me Awkward Anyway Ivor's figured out the wither storms are drawn to the amulet So we're going to lure them back to Saurin's Fortress and destroy the command block with an enchanted super weapon You figured all that out just now The point is we need to get moving We aren't safe [ __ ] Not as I don't know if I want to have this [ __ ] eye on my team G Oh I hate when I need a person that I don't like But we do actually need him don't we i What are the odds that he's going to [ __ ] up at the end again that he's going to scam us for clout or something like that he can say \"Oh I did it.\" Like he's going to steal the [ __ ] sword and he says \"Let me do it.\" And then he takes it and then boom it gets destroyed I can already smell it from a from a mile away Long as we have that amulet I'll take it Nine You can't Nine I can't and I have to Why but you could be killed We all could Olivia No I take it No way I can let you do that Axel You don't understand I'm not asking What i thought you'd trust me by now Oh you're done You just go make that super weapon It's going to fall I'll meet you back at Saurin's Fortress Well Axel shouldn't have to do this alone I'm going with him I appreciate that Jesse I'm going with him too Like you said I need to keep fighting Well I'm going with Jesse I I pledged to help and that's what I must do My guy my friends are still out there somewhere Nine And you must do this for them Everyone take good care of yourselves [ __ ] you too [ __ ] Oh wives look like I'm going to see him from the last time What was that Zoom jesse let's try our handshake again Just once for the road No the redstone wrap You got it I'll see you at Saurin All right Not if I see you first Please brother Oh [ __ ] Oh [ __ ] What are the odds that we will never meet again i need Axel to lock in He has the amulet He's crazy I mean he has the amulet because the wither follows the amulet right he wants to walk around like dogs So we can work while they're getting followed by the [ __ ] wither Can we go any faster not unless you have a minecart [Music] bro Sh How much have I have have I missed no Um you can watch the bot real quick from yesterday We played for 6 hours Today is the last time that we play this I hope I explained good though Like like a decent introduction again Oh man Okay so what's the plan right now we're trying to make this crazy [Music] sword Season two is better I don't know if I will be playing season 2 guys [Music] Mark Mama Can't be much longer right no not too much longer All [Music] right lock in boys Lock in the final push The final [Music] push through the snow through the [Music] desert to save the [ __ ] wood on a cheeky Tuesday He [ __ ] falls asleep the [ __ ] [ __ ] Iber [Music] Season 2 is [Music] crazy Really guys i'm also having a lot of fun but we also have a lot of other things to do like practice Counter Strike I need to stay at the top Uh time to move Let's go Oh will you just shut up already oh my god Calm down dude I [ __ ] hate him so much I swear to [Music] God if I if I could flint and steal his ass on fire I would do it right now Not going to lie All right here we go Where are we in a swamp My rear end is profoundly sore I feel like we've been riding forever I am telling you we cannot go to the Farlands They're not just the edge of our world but the limits of our comprehension The Farlands please The Farlands are a happy accident Nature's way of keeping life interest What call me crazy I watched it a a mech fit video on the Farlands When you go to the like close to the word border or something it's the Minecraft code [ __ ] up and it looks it's really crazy Are we go are we going there oh my god No no no They are perilous and unpredictable Pearl and noise floating points These are not matters to be toyed with bro Hold on Back up What exactly are the Farlands are you being serious the far lands lie at the very edge of all things where logic gives way to chaos They're a dangerous place to visit and a ridiculous place to construct a laboratory Just wait until you see it Do those two never stop arguing i don't know I'm too hungry to care Yeah I'm starving We all are Maybe we should turn back This is I have to say it How cool are the writers of this game like the story writers chat These things that you listen to in a like that is a failure of the code of Minecraft that people made a documentary on and that they include that in a game like this and not just some yep between some characters n the the metas are actually like tangible It's in Minecraft everything time swamps are too dangerous You never know what might be lurking around What was that my stomach Well I'm taking a I [ __ ] up I didn't say anything So am I Sher it's okay Let the team decide We mustn't linger long The farlands are just beyond this swamp So this could be our last chance to find food Wait I saw a wooden construct over there There may be a witch house Whoa whoa whoa whoa [Music] whoa Everyone doing okay not really We're starving Uh let's not do that People become kind of useless when they're hungry huh they're chilling right next to a pig I hope I hope he come back with Reuben still alive Let's see [Music] Oh chat If we don't eat [Music] them Boss burger Medium rare Oh I'm not going to eat it I'm going to take it Sweet A potato Sweet potato or sweeter potato potato You're coming with me It's not much but it'll help But it's honest work Yes Cerski Looks like another potato Sorry Chad I have to I want to see what they cooked up Like they say two potatoes is better than one Do I need to eat that's the question I think they say that Hey Jesse Have you found any food i should probably take what I have back to the group I want to see the house though I see a cake I see a cake Wait This is like a [ __ ] uh fable And then the [ __ ] thing with the red cap and then the wolf comes Oh hell no I'm going back to the group for a second But I really want to see it I need to check the cake Did it say witch hunt oh [Music] A witch is hut We should steer clear of it Nothing good ever happens when witches are involved Look a cake That's That's enough to feed everyone Yeah it isn't worth it Jesse Witches hate trespassers Besides there are plenty of potatoes around Is that a witch jesse we shouldn't be here Witches are very strong Get the cake The witch is over there Pass this up real quick Real quick I need you to watch my back I'm not a [ __ ] I'm telling you this is a bad idea Ivor you're not a good [ __ ] judge of telling what's a bad idea and what's not I'll keep watch Just be quick about it Lock in Lock in Lock in Lock in Lock in Get the chest Get the chest Now loot everything notion of leaping Cool Whatever What what does leaping mean viagra Entire Take it Take it Take it Down Oh god Look in Ivore This snitch He left us Ivore Why are we looking for him oh [ __ ] I [ __ ] up Oh no Oh no Oh no Jesse help us Uh-oh Oh no Oh no Why did I do that why did I do that hey you witch Everyone let's get out of here ASAP Ivore said the Farlands are just past the swamp Wait where is Ivor what i thought he was with you I don't know He disappeared outside the witch's hut Curse that fool of a man Low key Yes Come on Oh my god Guys I think we lost them for Wow I see your wow and raise you up The farlands Holy smokes It's like we're at the edge of the world Actually we seem to be at the corner of it Welcome to the Farlands my friend I've only seen this in the Mech Ffit video As I said millions of blocks away on 2b2t the Farlands I'm glad Jesse snagged this cake Makes the whole wall of insanity thing a lot easier to face Gotcha Say what you like about witches they sure know how to make a cake Was it stretching skyward in all its glory like a monument to chaos itself so what am I looking at here exactly this is a natural phenomenon The intersection of two of the great walls that form the boundary of our world Very few have seen it in person Incredible You can say that again Incredible My fault Should have seen that coming How can Ivore live here i mean it's one thing to build a wool world inside the end but this Oh I doubt he lives here He most likely comes here only for his most secretive research Whatever Ivor is hiding in here it will be extremely well guarded Whoa Ivor's secret base This way I suspect I'd feel better about this if Axel and Petra were here I know what you mean Right [ __ ] Come on Let's hurry up so we get back to them faster Am I the only one really excited right now inside of Ivra's secret base where he does all his [ __ ] up [ __ ] Is this a maze it would appear so A massive one from the looks of it If Ivore used the command block to build this it could hold unspeakable peril So maybe we should not just wander into the world's hardest maze without a guide Unfortunately this seems to be the only way forward There has to be another way A secret door or I don't know We followed Ivore to the far Might as well keep going How to Here we go break any maze Another dungeon of doom Watch this With the simple trick you can directly go through any maze And the trick is you always go left You always go to the same side and that way and that way at one point you will have the correct way May take some time but trust me Can I go here no The game only lets me go one way That ain't gravel What the wa that is one of the coolest things I have ever seen Looks like fish Our lands may be perilous but they are indisputably fascinating We should probably keep moving God damn A stone waterfall huh only in the Farlands Dude I wish we lived in Minecraft Guys looks like this is a There's too many W Still got it I'm still got it Back Oh no we alone Chad We alone Lock in Lock in I can use the potion of leaping No Why did I climb i didn't mean to do that Climb the vines No I meant to use the potion Uh-oh What is leaping chat well that worked I suppose Yeah I guess it's high jumps Okay that's much better then We saved Yeah but now what we're all separated We still got the potion which is huge Let's just head that way and find a place where the pads connect Secret Sure hope they don't get lost in there I hope I don't get lost in there Nope With that one simple trick always going left Oh man it lets you sprint The first time the game lets you sprint so there will be a lot Oh jeez creepers Always go left I think it's safe to say the farlands are strange Watch this Chad You can beat any maze by always going left any left Ivor's Hey that must be Ivor's lab That is sick as a little closer [ __ ] dude I want to build that in Minecraft myself Spider left Left Wait is that left yes Is that I I don't know what his left is This is left No Oh [ __ ] This is right Wait how does this track work when there's a dead end now this is [Music] left Dead end And now left Left Left Oh man Wait this is actually a mess She has all potion by the way Oh what got it Shoot Oh hell no You got to be kidding me We have no sticks to craft another one This is [Music] bad Going to go there Left Always go [Music] left Keep going Keep going Don't tell me I'm missing insane loot chat Oh man Wait this is actually a [ __ ] big old maze Chat some people are saying that this used to be on Netflix How did the How did this work on Netflix olivia did you have to do it with your remote control [Music] sher which E Got it Draw the bow Shoot E Shoot E We have one more arrow Last one Nice Woo Jeez Louise The witch is crazy Which way do I got to go this way Right That witch got me mixed up Am I going back i [Music] am What we were talking about uh the the the Netflix thing Did you still were able to make decisions chat or did you just get like one playthrough you were that's sick as [ __ ] Did they do it after they realized that the game is not selling like they made a deal with Netflix that's kind of boss So that way at least a lot of people still like saw it and stuff you know and got to experience their own play through Netflix Minecraft Sorry they removed it as well Ooh no way Who played it off you guys type [Music] what i'm good Right [Music] Oh wait Why is the camera so far away huh what's that oh that's a travel device Damn lots of ones Straight to the hut But Loki I want to wait for my friends First the loot First we loot then we look [Music] Looks like Ivore kept some redstone dust handy Not bad And a slime ball Not bad [Music] I don't see a way [Music] across Wait I have a crafting table but slime and red stone I can't do [ __ ] with that Do I use it huh redstone blocks some pistons I wonder what this thing's supposed to be Hello anyone olivia is that you jesse there you are [Music] I thought I'd never find you All those dead ends back there Any sign of the others not yet This maze We don't have time for this Uh-huh Dude I hope that the game teleports me to the [ __ ] beginning once we have to go out I am not re [ __ ] routing the maze like like reverse I'm not doing that I'm not doing that chat That may be where the run ends if I have to go back through that maze Who even knows where the others are by now i mean the clock's ticking here Jesse Yet we're lost in some elaborate puzzle to have to really need to figure out what happened to the others I wonder if they found some other way across this gaping bottomless pit I think it drops forever Jesus What about this thing could it get us across chad does this actually work some kind of flying bars invented on Minecraft It would probably get us to the other side but it's in really bad shape That's so cool And it's really complicated You can fix it though right i don't know I think it's out of my league I wish I'd had more time to study with Elegard Can't be that complicated Not if it's something Ivor built Halfbuilt which means it was hard enough that he got stuck and gave up If I have to fix it I don't any sense What was Ivor thinking or maybe it's just me I mean Eligard herself said \"I don't have what it takes to be a great engineer.\" She was right I just can't hack it Oh no I might as well be a carrot farmer So prove her wrong Show the world what you're made of Prove her wrong Jesse She's the greatest redstone engineer ever She's in the Order of the Stone Sure but the order are still people just like us That's true right just like us I mean how are we the ones saving the world when even they don't have what it takes saurin and Ivore are always at each other's throats The greatest warrior in history doesn't remember his own name None of them give Elelligard any respect And Magnus lost his life trying to fight this Don't jump What the hell can't do this Oh my god I thought How are we supposed to Jesus how are we supposed to do anything we're nobody You want to give up and before they both Order of the Nothing All I know is the world is depending on us And maybe the world is in trouble I mean they defeated an Ender Dragon Can you name even one thing we've done right and I don't mean managing to stay alive Well for starters we're the ones who brought them back together Facts You and I found Eligard together Yep We both played a role with Saurin Yeah I suppose that's true Did I really tweet that can I i have to see Dude people think I'm crazy Oh my god [ __ ] All right I'll try it one more time Oh no You got it right Wait a second I think I see what he was trying to do Jesse take this piston craft it into a sticky piston then place it on the other side of the barge along with a redstone block What what you got all that uh I think so Yeah Put the piston near the red stone and I craft a uh sword Sticky piston The sooner the better Oh my god I guessed it I'm him without cheats And now we do a sticky redstone piston Whatever that means What else what else does it want me to craft did I just see a skeleton what am I hearing oh a redstone block I love redstone blocks They're so cool You know they're oozing energy Always activated Ready to turn on any machine at nighttime at daytime Boss Very boss Redstone block Okay let's put the redstone block where it's supposed to go and place these pistons Uh oh my god I'm so smart No way Only me Holy cow we did it We need flint and steel to get it started I'm proud of you Thanks Jesse And Thanks for everything you said just before Chicken jockey said he didn't chill My MS will have to clean all of this up You guys need to chill It must be this way Run Oh my What everybody get on I think that's correct Onto the bar Zombies are slow [ __ ] zombies Go That's a lot of zombies Flick that seal Uh-oh Uhoh Uhoh Chessy Oh no Oh no I didn't get it Did I oh thank the Lord I did What happens if I don't get that i just died That was close Everyone okay for the moment i remember something Didn't Eligard build a machine like this once yes In the Nether And you were terrified of flying on it What stuffing nonsense No no I'm positive You spent the whole ride quivering in terror Saurin are you afraid of flying but the the man's mad He's wither crazy Well I suppose I might be mistaken I liked you better when you had amnesia Bang We got it Here we go Let's see what the base looks like Huh [Music] well that was exciting By exciting I assume you mean absurd and unnecessary At least we made it Let's go see what he's hiding in there Bat rock What that's insane How [Music] Lapis lousy So many books Blocks We should be careful This place could be booby trapped Yes Let's just start looking for the enchanting book Oh my god Yo Hey Lucas Having any luck no just I've been thinking about other stuff actually stuff such as friends Let me guess You know Gabriel the ocelots man [ __ ] those People getting wither sickness and amnesia Don't get me wrong I'm Don't clip that out of context If that's a gang somewhere around this world I mean the Minecraft one Uh-oh Glad I came with you I just I'm just scared for everyone For them for us for everybody really Don't worry so much Lucas There's no point Not when you can't do anything about them He's pissing me off I know We just have to focus on what's in front of us Namely a zillion books I guess being an angry loner leaves you a lot of time to read Tell me about it How to Train Your Slime The various uses of mushroom stew Potionology volume 24 Are any of them the enchanting book i don't think so Book brief history of cubism Crafting for noobs revised A collector's guide to precious gems Noobs None of these are enchanting books There's Walt That is Walt Olivia Olivia Any luck not really Ivor has too many books and there's too few of us looking How did we end up all split up like this i feel like we're spreading ourselves too thin I miss how things used to be That first night we all spent together That was kind of fun Almost Look we might be spread thin but we're all still a team That's how teams work Hey you almost said teamwork See we're still funny We can still get things done I guess being split up just means we can be in more places at once right Kind of like the wither storm Let's just forget that metaphor Got to stay positive Not going to lie Like yeah some of these answers are depressing I'm not going to click them bro We are still a team right now Let's not think about you know like the the faster we work the sooner we get back Find anything yet huh in this mess uh it's as though Ivore learned nothing from my lectures on organizational methodology If only he hadn't gotten lost in that confounded swamp He could just tell us where the book is Coming here was his idea He should be here for it [ __ ] him He can be pretty stupid for someone so smart Yes And this house is a perfect example There's neither rhyme nor reason to how these books are stored Finding anything here is impossible Tedious maybe Impossible No way Fine I will continue this monotonous search but I reserve my right to grumble about it It's a deal Reuben you find anything reuben what are you doing yeah well you're going to get yourself cooked I've told you before stay away from lava Don't want to get turned into a la lava chicken What is this hey Olivia I think there's some redstone over here Looks like a circuit We probably just need a lever to power it Too bad I don't have one Yeah no lever No functioning circuit Nine Dude I want to see what happens This Ivore character I'm recalling that he knew something about potions Could one of these stop the wither monsters i'm remembering correctly am I not what do you remember i seem to recall that Ivor was better with potions than people And he he keep Chad the potion Did we throw it the one that Axel stole we used it right like it didn't work Okay Yeah Going Nothing else is coming besides the whole Ivor being a jerk thing A potion of blindness and potion of dullness Potion of nausea None of these will help me Or do we just miss the command block jesse am I going to be all right or is this just who I am now always struggling to remember what I was Don't worry we're going to find a way to fix you I mean you and Petra and everyone else that were the Storm I mean it But to do that you'll need to destroy the command block will you not so that's exactly what we'll do You never stop fighting I admire that Give me that loot H wonder what's in there Well open it We need red zone Wood planks Those are at least we can make a swad again Wooden one Makes sense that Ivore would have a craft Wait lever Oh my god First I'll need some sticks Wait wait I have an idea Chad We have cobble and got the sticks And we have sticks This should be a lever Oh my god There we go Good oldfashioned lever Lever Is that British English lock in like it was made for it which it was Do it Let's see what this sucker does Hidden door right behind the lava I know it Chicken jockey I've played these games before I've toured many many bases And that's a classic Secret passageway Hm Why would you build a secret passage in a house nobody ever visits what's down there like why wouldn't you secret passageways are cool Good point What's down there in that dungeon whoa Trip wire What the Oh no Are you guys okay we're fine but the lever isn't working anymore And we got a pickax there We'll head down and see what we can find Dude if only we had a diamond pickaxe I swear God man Wa What is all this like a dragon egg He's gathered them all in one place Gather what she is Thanos of Minecraft The treasures of the Order of the Stone Holy [ __ ] The stories I could tell about these dusty old things Wow I don't see any enchanting books though Maybe through there Dragon egg Uh locked of course Chad is there any are there any dupes in Minecraft Story Mode i want to dupe that Dragon Egg now There must be some way to open it One for me one for Reuben one for Axel No I think those are gas tears Damn these gas tears They're super hard to get I want everything You don't know the half of it Wait it's on a pressure plate First official mission is the Order of the Stone Wait it's on a pressure plate Those gas for hours I didn't see it And these tears were our reward Wow No no no Don't take it Jacy what are you doing uh taking this really cool rare item We might need it to unlock that door So obviously I didn't see it Very well Just be careful Oh no I want to go back No No See wait We're fine now That's pretty bright I don't need the sea lantern but I really want the dragon egg Chad I need it It's also on a pressure plate though No way Is that what I think it is dude i need it I need it chat There's only one in every Minecraft world I need it But it's on a [ __ ] pressure plate What is he saying so why does Ivore have the treasures of the Order of the Stone did he steal them no no no no no We We let him keep them when we split up You let him keep your treasures frankly Jesse it's a long story I don't buy that So why does Ivore have the treasures of the Order of My the Stone steal them no no no no We We let him keep them when we split up You let him keep your chest I'm not going to do it three times Frankly Jesse it's a long story Guys I have to take it I have to take it Please let me take it I need it in my inventory Look we have the gaster in our inventory I need the dragon egg Saurin is this the actual Ender Dragon egg uh alas yes The only thing that remains of our final adventure together [ __ ] No way I'm leaving this behind Wait We're good We're [Music] good What is this prismarine crystals You got to be kidding me Let me take this one first This one is not under a pressure plate Am I crazy or is this a sea lantern this one is safe The very same one the order built all those years ago We were so green back then It looks just as bright as on the day we crafted it A ceiling Huh well nothing happens Nothing's going to happen on the first one These are prismarine crystals You can only get these underwater right precisely We nearly ran out of oxygen getting these Eligard had to use a spare bucket just to grab a few extra breaths Damn We use most of these to craft a sea lantern I'm such a scumbag is all that remains About to take it Prismarine is word What now prismarine [Music] this guy Jeez Louise All right Um damn We took everything We're kind of Gucci Chad Nothing happened But what now what the so why does Ivak have the treasures of the Order of the Stone did he steal them no No No No No We We let him I'm not going to do it four times All right I thought it would unlock a new thing Keep your treasures Frankly Jesse it's a long story All [Music] right Ready at the door wait what wait Whoa Oh the last one Packed ice I've only ever heard of this stuff I take it So where did this packed ice come from i take it We brought it back from the ice plane spikes biome All the pressure plates will be lifted Something will happen But mag security measurements Our laughter kept us I'm calling lava from top Maybe a chicken We knew we were ready to face the ender dragon like in a museum Ooh cold and slippery Here it comes Whoa Dropppers Aha A hopper Why is Ivore hiding a hopper in his basement what the heck is this looks like a regular hopper that's hooked up to a bunch of redstone circuitry Man Ivort sure does love his puzzles Oh no Huh five slots Five items Question is where do I put what maybe there's a hint in the Maybe there's a hint in the um I can't get out Oh no we have to finish it now Packed ice Saurin said they got this ice just before fighting the Ender Dragon Wait Ender Dragon after ice Ender Dragon egg So cool This egg was the last thing they got as the last thing Ice right before What about pristine shot prismarine crystal The order used these crystals to make the sea lantern A sea lantern Saurin said this lantern was crafted from prismarine crystals and the gastier Huh the right objects Bang Guess it was the wrong order What no Wait Why do you reset it why did you reset it why do you reset it let's try them here Surren of the order got these gas tears on their very All right Off the top of my dome because I'm not stupid Other people would have to replay again I'm not that guy I'm not that guy Yes Okay you solved it But how in the world did you know what order to put them in there were 120 possible combinations I'll give him credit More or less Everything I needed was in your stories Nice work Jesse I don't care about or I don't care about nothing I don't care about people thinking I'm the coolest His time with the order clearly meant a great deal to him Yeah I guess so Anyway I want that enchanting book Here we go By the stars the Ender Dragon with replica ender crystals and all Wow I always wondered what it looked like H No way out I didn't see it Is this supposed to be the dragon this was trash Looks like a banner about TNT All right I'm not going to not going to click that Reuben any idea what [Music] happens h interesting What's the riddle here lights on off That's a sword Well banner of a sword anyway Back toback riddles Oh man I need a reset There's a lot of brain power needed right now I think we turned them all on That's a sword Well banner of a sword Anyway turned them all on right nate we pressed the button once It's a button One more One more Easiest drill of my life I pressed all four but it isn't doing anything Oh no [ __ ] me Saurin what's this thing supposed to be it appears to be an homage to our battle with the Ender Dragon Despite his anger Ivore never stopped being fond of us He was a big part of our team after all We're missing something here Saurin And I have a feeling the key might be locked in that head of yours Facts I have a key locked in my head What I'm saying is I think you need to tell me about the Ender Dragon battle Oh listen closely If only you'd been there It was a fight for the ages We'd spent weeks preparing for our greatest battle ever Holy [ __ ] But even so the Ender Dragon was stronger than even I had imagined I realized that it was drawing strength from the ender crystals and that the crystals had to be destroyed I hit the first with a perfectly placed arrow Me and Casual The second I destroyed by launching myself on the shot of Magnus' TNT Using only my strength and my wilds I steered the foul beast toward the third crystal I flew the dragon directly toward the final pistol 911 Whoa I was kidding Only then did Gabriel deliver his famous final blow W Gabriel my hero I can see my man heroes but he did nothing Legends The greatest the world has ever known Buddy did nothing Uh Saurin you are so full [ __ ] I just clicked something Oh man I didn't mean that Why would you say that i just clicked something I wish I thought I should [ __ ] What did I say wrong i'm lying Oh okay But on barges not dragons And besides you made it sound like you were the only one who mattered I was the leader Believe you me I didn't mean that Whatever Wonder if that story will help me solve this Sh Sir I don't know how to fix this riddle though So Saurin rode the dragon huh there's a lever Saurin guys I I don't understand Reuben talk to me Reuben do you know what to do here well faded It's worth a shot Okay Okay So first first we This is last cuz he killed him The dragon with the sword First was was first the bow Yeah First he killed one thing that makes him regenerate health Then he TNT onto the dragon right what is his last one redstone When did we use redstone when did we use [Music] redstone shoot a lot of arrows at that Okay Yeah Yeah Redstone and then complete five fat Aha There's another door Chicken jockey Wait what what do you mean another door the hell saurin tell me the story again Certainly No We'd spent weeks preparing for our greatest No no no I can't skip this Maybe the short version Thank God Well all right I destroyed one crystal with my bow The next using a TNT shockwave the third with Eligard's redstone cannon A fourth from upon the dragon itself Yes And then Gabriel poked it dead with a sword How was that better Thanks What are we missing why is it not open do you need to do it again okay I'll put it one more time Bow and arrow Great weapons Looks like a banner about TNT Why would I put it backwards let me try this That's redstone That's a sword Well wait Oh my god Sword Anyway you got to be joking [ __ ] I didn't even pay attention Wait I can't do it anymore I thought I was pressing the buttons chat I'm kind of faded I went to the gym today Wait I don't I don't I don't I I don't know what to do I leaping potion up That will be trigger Chad guys there's no other option Go to the level Yeah What do you want me to do Chad quickly quickly mine some blocks with my hand and [ __ ] build up there You think this is [ __ ] Minecraft hello i can't go up there What do I do use the bow maybe no Can't select it either I can But that won't work Chad I don't even have arrows Use the potion No bro No bro What the heck interact with the door How i can't You see the camera won't let me Whoa Whoa There it is There it is Climbed the dragon back We just got to get up there Hey Reuben give me a boost will you hawk I'll distrike Davage your pants All right Here we go baby Here we go Lever in 3 2 1 Aha it did all happen like Sauron said Bravo you did it we did There's the book Alter alter and with this we can enchant our sword to destroy the command block Lots of power in that book Ender crystal Oh man those ender crystals like the real ones No they they can't be not here Not after all this time But that's impossible Ivor couldn't have these in a basement in the Farlands right Saurin he kept them The fool actually kept them I have an idea We can revive the dragon And then the dragon fights against the wither cinema He looked me in the eye and swore he was going to dispose of them Saurin you said destroying these crystals was the key to defeating the Ender Dragon You did kill the Ender Dragon right jesse this isn't this isn't what it looks like Our story The story It's It's mostly true I swear I swear Whatever you're thinking I promise I can explain Saurin I want the truth and I want it now I I can't We swore never to speak of it I don't care buddy If you don't spit it out I'm going to activate one of those crystals and you're dead Talk I'm afraid I haven't been honest with you Jesse We did defeat the Ender Dragon but it wasn't exactly like I said How not exactly We got rid of it but we didn't kill it per se In fact we didn't even fight it So what did you do to it we didn't do anything We used that damned command block You used the command block to defeat the Ender Dragon [Music] i'm afraid so I knew your story didn't add up Understand when I found that blasted block we were nobodyies But with its help we became stronger Faster We could do so much more The others had no idea what I was doing Yet the more I used it the more we came to depend on it I knew it was only so long before someone would find out frauds So I concocted a plan I would use the command block to blink the Ender Dragon out of existence What [Music] securing our status as legends forever We told the world we defeated a dragon and the rest is history You cheated You You worse than cheated Yep You're a fraud You're going to get banned Believe me I know So you finally admit it Oh [ __ ] Saurin how could you ival how long have you guys been standing there long enough that they heard the whole thing So we're liars All of us Yeah I think you are You didn't think you could keep it secret forever did you Saurin the truth hurts doesn't it but Ivore why is this why you left the order because Saurin lied Because they all did No way Saurin Gabriel Magnus Eligard they agreed to keep this a secret How conniving of us And you you agreed to stay quiet too in exchange for all of our treasures What i've technically never told anybody Jesse discovered the truth on his own So this whole thing this wither you unleashed has all been to teach the order a lesson To teach the world a lesson To show you who the order really are Liars cowards and now they know Yes I suppose they do And how is that any better you reveal their lies at the expense of the world itself Look my wither plan obviously backfired You think i didn't know we'd end up with three of those things tearing the world apart For a moment I nearly forgot Which brings us back to why we're here We need to destroy that command block Like now Jesse's right Destroying the command block is all that matters anymore How ironic that the best thing the command block gave us was the very means to destroy it Spare us the poetry It's not your strong suit I've had this book for years Never thought I better work How do I use the book let's get on with it I'd actually have to use it This thing better work because if it doesn't you don't I'm part of the gold as well I guess Hey sorry for cheating G Need to say it Can you be really mad at me follow me I'll show you Ivore I'm sorry about everything Yes well it doesn't matter now But still I don't like how Ivan reacts ingredients and craft a weapon But I do get it He doesn't like cheaters Enchanted Whoa Sweet Showtime Let's see what Ivor is Oh we can choose our skin Oh my god Thought I've got a cream chest first Let's see There's a bunch of crafting stuff and diamond scored Should have gotten that one uh [ __ ] 10 minutes into the game if you remember Anvil crafting table Can't enchant the weapon until I craft the weapon We have three diamonds and we have three sticks Wait we can make a sword So I can craft whatever I want huh anything at all anything at all say less Wait We can make a hole Now will this really let me make an axe or hoe and defeat it with a hoe doesn't matter what it's enchanted on right a pickaxe would be OP not going to lie If this lets us do it I don't know if it will I will try a pickaxe N I want the X Take it out I don't know if this will work What if I waste the diamonds 3 2 1 guys I don't want to make a sword You know why because that's Gabriel's weapon I don't know why but I have a weird feeling about crafting a sword I I feel like I don't know I I don't know man We can always use his sword in if this ax turns out to not be usable I'm not making a shovel chat I am not making a shovel But then we would keep some [Music] diamonds Make a hole Would it let me no shot guys Am I throwing the game if I make a hole here [Music] i want to see how we defeat it with the hoe Not going to lie Shovel a hoe No way I'm feeling a shovel It's the least amount of diamond investment We get to keep two This could come in handy And the shovel will still do its job just like a hoe because we just enchanted with the thing that kills the command block We can make a shovel and a sword as a backup too I'm making a shovel I'm locked But I don't know if this is a good idea An axe Yes I could craft a pickaxe A shovel A hoe All right Loki we have to get the hole Loki we have to get the hoe I'm taking a hole [ __ ] it Oh god Awesome I've never owned a diamond weapon Just wait till you enchant it Oh god Aho Let's see what this enchanting book is made of There are my enchanted It's like a reaper exit All right Best idea ever Holy smokes That should do the job nicely But if you're fighting those wither monsters head on you'll want better armor too I enchanted these for the order They're about as strong as it comes Oh my god Chad Even able to withstand TNT This is my dream Any preference yes Yes Let me choose Oh my god I have eight different sets to choose from We can finish it All excellent I I I need this I know This is nice Like Yeah Magnos because he died fast Chat those look cream I have to I'm sorry All right let me take a look at him It's all quite durable and sturdy Oh the adamantine impervium Even harder to damage than it is to pronounce Oh dude the blue one looks insane in the purple one I call this the star shield No object in the universe can penetrate it Dragon's Bane Oh even the Ender Dragon would have fled from this in terror Dragon's pain sounds crazy I call this one the shield of infinity No small part because it's infinity I like those colors too This is sword breaker All but the strongest of weapons which shatter against it I call this one the Ender Defender guys Very strong against an Enderman's attack That may come in handy too That's the redstone riot Engineered to be virtually indestructible I don't like that That's goofy That's nerdy What is this this one is named Golden Goliath As bright and powerful as the sun itself Gold Gold Gold That's all Chad listen to me We all know that 90% of the people that played this game probably picked this purple one I don't want to be that guy and take what everyone else takes I'm feeling this one the Ender Defender I like those colors And I really like this one too I call this the Star Shield Chad no object in the universe can trade it No I can't take the golden one Not even for the meme chat Nine Hell no Hell no Hell no Hell no Hell no I'm not running around like a goof lord in [ __ ] yellow which yellow is just a goofy color to wear I'm not doing that bro I'm not doing that bro Gold on the screen Build in my inventory Yes we already have the golden hole Wait it fits to our hoe Wait Oh I don't know dude But gold looks so weird sometimes No like this will look goofy on us What the purple one ch like I think the coolest one is this one Like for me personally for my taste [ __ ] Busy cruiser cussy on the busy Thank you for the five gifted subs Let me get some hearts in the [ __ ] chat Thanks bro Chad [ __ ] puffer fish What combines the best with the golden hoe like look at the colors of the hoe chat on the left It's golden and it has like a per like a green thing at the end It will look so boss with this The golden one it will just look goofy I want the hole to be the centerpiece of our drip when we finish the ender rank not the [ __ ] goofy armor I'm sorry man I I had to say it It's between Say left or right Between this one or this one Left or right left or right left or right Sorry Chad Sorry I I can't I can't I can't This is very important We need to look cool when we destroy the world Okay I'm going right Oh my god I love it This will look so clean in chat because look the end of the ho It fits to the skull too All right this is the set Trust me Yes a fine choice Now go ahead I'm so happy right now I'm so happy Holy [ __ ] Holy [ __ ] Nah How do I look nah Ready for action Oh my god You can take some for your friends as well Sounds good to me Oh my god I look ready Cool armor Jesse Thanks W And there's plenty to go around Holy smokes that home fortress and see how the wither storms are doing against those enderman Nah we are bossy Holy [ __ ] Already we have the enchanted Shouldn't the Enderman have dismantled those things by now or am I just confused yeah Wait what is Axa doing it's not just you Something's wrong Jesse over here Hey Axel Petra you're okay Thank the Lord You guys made it Nice freaking armor by the way Thank you Hey Petra Are you all right no I'm barely hanging on I should have stayed in that cave Except you saved my butt like a dozen times He's exaggerating I found a couple potions to keep me going Yeah but I'm all out You guys still have the amulet safe and sound That's not the problem Then what is the Enderman they're not angry enough I mean some of them are but a lot of them are just standing around moving blocks You know being Enderman They've kept the main weather storm busy but one of the smaller ones started attacking us Yeah So Elelligard ran out to fight that thing all by herself She's fighting a wither storm alone Yeah Kept saying something about paying for the mistakes of the past Whatever that means If a fellow member of the Order of the of the uh Order of the Stone is out there fighting then I belong out there too Gabriel no No I told you you're not who you think you are My name is Gabriel the Warrior The [ __ ] are you doing and he's running the wrong way Oh for goodness sake I'm not letting that idiot get himself killed Gabriel come back here Actual W He's growing on me Chad Hammer is growing on me None of them stands a chance I don't know man Say what now why do they need the command block trust me you don't want to know Yeah I do Uh no you don't Shouldn't have said that Um okay Petra Jesse Guys I can't do this anymore You need to go on without me What no I fought as hard as I could but this is where it ends for me Petra we need you This is it The final fight I know how bad

what the game has to offer after this I don't care I am so sorry He was a great pig What what i don't care about any of these guys to care about R I do care but I 10 times more care about Reuben Hello How all my answers I said Reuben Reuben Reuben I don't understand I don't understand I don't understand I don't understand I don't understand Did every kid refund the game because they were so sad afterwards hello I don't get it Nature this is not fair This is not [ __ ] fair I don't care if that's another episode I'm not continuing I'm not continuing without Reuben Tell me Reuben [Music] gets guys Are you serious [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i don't count I don't count [Music] People used to look at me like that once Jesse Having my memory restored has been both a blessing and a curse Perhaps they deserve to know the truth about the order All those lies we told them I don't care about any of this Roman You're right They do deserve to know I'm pissed We all owe a great debt to Jesse and his friends but I owe a debt to you people as well Which is why there is something I want to tell you about the [Music] order The order of the I don't perma ban people but chat 2005 and you say we're having bacon for dinner tonight You are over 20 years old typing that after Reuben just died I don't care I don't care I don't I do not care You disrespect Reuben nine Hell no Not even when he can defend himself He would [ __ ] you the [ __ ] up And you know it You say it now after he died Disgusting The stone is not what you all believed We were frauds We used the command block to falsify our legacy We were no heroes So it is time for the world to celebrate new heroes Real heroes [Music] Thank you Thank you everyone I know you think I'm up here because I saved the world or something but the truth is I didn't do it alone Far from it You see I I also had my pig Reuben I could never have done this without him He gave me advice picked me up when I was down and in the end he saved every one of us I'll really miss the little guy We all will Anyway it's crazy to think my friend and I started out in a treehouse and now anyway into some of the weirdest places in the world Nope I mean come on We traveled through the Nether by minecart How cool is that i'm pissed But when all was said and done you know what really mattered what are they waiting for finishing what we set out to do Cuz there's no way we were going to let a world this cool get torn apart We did it [Music] [Applause] I'm so mad right now Jesse this Nether Star is all that remained when the Wither Storm was destroyed Would you please do the honors [Music] this is going to be so cool [Applause] [Music] [Music] Wow I would I would be popping a beer right now my friend If Reuben was there I am now pleased to introduce to you This doesn't matter to me anymore It doesn't The new order of the stove [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] And so it was that a new order of the stone was born One whose adventures were only just beginning For though the world had been saved and the command block destroyed there are many more worlds than just this one I'm pissed I wanted a happy ending This is the worst ending I don't I saving the world Nice But without my partner guys Was it because I got the one thing wrong talk to me Be- because I didn't choose the TNT cannon and then she said pick cannon Does he die anyway yes or no i need to know You can't save him What yo the deaths are tweaking Chad I'm sad as a grown-up 26 years of age If I was 15 I played this game I wouldn't go to school the next day I swear on everything I swear on everything I wouldn't What that's crazy You can't save Reuben dude The way they just put like all of the sudden he boops and then pops a pork chop That is wild That is wild No shot Hey sadness aside awareness aside bad ending aside the game itself up to the point where Room was alive big W Lowkey Big W I did enjoy that more than I thought I\n"
